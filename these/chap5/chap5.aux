\newlabel{fig:CO2setup}{{IV.24}{127}{CO$_2$ laser machining setup for fiber mirror fabrication. (a) Picture of the setup, where we can see the CO$_2$ laser path, the imaging path, and the fiber mounted on a 3-axis translation stage. (b) Schematic of the setup, showing the CO$_2$ laser beam focused onto the cleaved fiber tip using a lens. The fiber is mounted on a 3-axis translation stage to allow precise positioning and focusing of the laser beam. The precision translation stages allow to move the fiber in and out of the laser focus as needed, implement multiple laser shoot routines, and go back and forth between imaging and machining. The imaging part uses a 515nm LED source along with a Mirau objective to reconstruct the fiber profile interferometrically}{figure.caption.116}{}}
