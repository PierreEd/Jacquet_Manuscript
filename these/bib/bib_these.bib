  abstract  = "Quantum mechanics dictates that the precision of physical
               measurements must always comply with certain noise constraints.
               In the case of interferometric displacement measurements, these
               restrictions impose a standard quantum limit (SQL), which
               optimally balances the precision of a measurement with its
               unwanted backaction1. To go beyond this limit, one must devise
               more sophisticated measurement techniques, which either `evade'
               the backaction of the measurement2 or achieve clever
               cancellation of the unwanted noise at the detector3,4. In the
               half-century since the SQL was established, systems ranging from
               LIGO5 to ultracold atoms6 and nanomechanical devices7,8 have
               pushed displacement measurements towards this limit, and a
               variety of sub-SQL techniques have been tested in
               proof-of-principle experiments9--13. However, so far, no
               experimental system has successfully demonstrated an
               interferometric displacement measurement with sensitivity
               (including all relevant noise sources---thermal, backaction and
               imprecision) below the SQL. Here, we exploit strong quantum
               correlations in an ultracoherent optomechanical system to
               demonstrate off-resonant force and displacement sensitivity
               reaching 1.5 dB below the SQL. This achieves an outstanding goal
               in mechanical quantum sensing and further enhances the prospects
               of using such devices for state-of-the-art force sensing
               applications.Strong quantum correlations in an ultracoherent
               optomechanical system are used to demonstrate a displacement
               sensitivity that is below the standard quantum limit.",

A 10-\&\#x3BC;m-long microcavity with a mode volume of 40\&\#x3BC;m3 was set up with two such mirrors, and the cavity linewidth was measured both spectrally and temporally. The smallest linewidth obtained was 96MHz, corresponding to a quality factor of 3.3\&\#xD7;106 and a finesse in excess of 1.5\&\#xD7;105. With these parameters, we estimate that a variety of solid-state quantum emitters coupled to the cavity may enter the strong coupling regime.},

abstract = {Many protocols in quantum science and technology require initializing a system in a pure quantum state. In the context of the motional state of massive resonators, this enables studying fundamental physics at the elusive quantum--classical transition, and measuring force and acceleration with enhanced sensitivity. Laser cooling has been a method of choice to prepare mechanical resonators in the quantum ground state, one of the simplest pure states. However, to overcome the heating and decoherence by the thermal bath, this usually has to be combined with cryogenic cooling. Here, we laser-cool an ultracoherent, soft-clamped mechanical resonator close to the quantum ground state directly from room temperature. To this end, we implement the versatile membrane-in-the-middle setup with one fiber mirror and one phononic crystal mirror, which reaches a quantum cooperativity close to unity already at room temperature. We furthermore introduce a powerful combination of coherent and measurement-based quantum control techniques, which allows us to mitigate thermal intermodulation noise. The lowest occupancy we reach is 30 phonons, limited by measurement imprecision. Doing away with the necessity for cryogenic cooling should further facilitate the spread of optomechanical quantum technologies.},

               backaction of light has been observed only in pioneering
               experiments in which an optical restoring force controls the
               oscillator stiffness1,2. For solid-state mechanical resonators
               in which oscillations are controlled by the material rigidity,
               the observation of these effects has been hindered by low
               mechanical quality factors, optical cavity frequency
               fluctuations3, thermal intermodulation noise4,5 and photothermal
               instabilities. Here we overcome these challenges with a
               phononic-engineered membrane-in-the-middle system. By using
               phononic-crystal-patterned cavity mirrors, we reduce the cavity
               frequency noise by more than 700-fold. In this ultralow noise
               cavity, we insert a membrane resonator with high thermal
               conductance and a quality factor (Q) of 180 million, engineered
               using recently developed soft-clamping techniques6,7. These
               advances enable the operation of the system within a factor of
               2.5 of the Heisenberg limit for displacement sensing8, leading
               to the squeezing of the probe laser by 1.09(1) dB below the
               vacuum fluctuations. Moreover, the long thermal decoherence time
               of the membrane oscillator (30 vibrational periods) enables us
               to prepare conditional displaced thermal states of motion with
               an occupation of 0.97(2) phonons using a multimode Kalman

abstract = {Ultralow-loss concave micromirrors with radius of curvature below 60\&\#x3BC;m were fabricated by laser ablation and reflective coatings. A 10-\&\#x3BC;m-long microcavity with a mode volume of 40\&\#x3BC;m3 was set up with two such mirrors, and the cavity linewidth was measured both spectrally and temporally. The smallest linewidth obtained was 96MHz, corresponding to a quality factor of 3.3\&\#xD7;106 and a finesse in excess of 1.5\&\#xD7;105. With these parameters, we estimate that a variety of solid-state quantum emitters coupled to the cavity may enter the strong coupling regime.},

We present a complete quantum theory of this system, and derive simple conditions on when the quantum limit on the added noise can be surpassed. We also study the conditional dynamics of the measurement, and discuss how such a scheme (when coupled with feedback) can be used to generate and detect squeezed states of the oscillator. Our results are relevant to experiments in optomechanics, and to experiments in quantum electromechanics employing stripline resonators coupled to mechanical resonators.},

            We analyze the performance of a force detector based on balanced measurements with a Mach–Zehnder interferometer incorporating a standard optomechanical cavity. The system is driven by a coherent superposition of coherent light and squeezed vacuum field, providing quantum correlation along with optical coherence in order to enhance the measurement sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit. We analytically find the optimal measurement strength, squeezing direction, and squeezing strength at which the symmetrized power spectral density for the measurement noise is minimized below the standard quantum limit. This force detection scheme based on a balanced Mach–Zehnder interferometer provides better sensitivity compared to that based on balanced homodyne detection with a local oscillator in the low frequency regime.},

            The fields of optomechanics and electromechanics have facilitated numerous advances in the areas of precision measurement and sensing, ultimately driving the studies of mechanical systems into the quantum regime. To date, however, the quantization of the mechanical motion and the associated quantum jumps between phonon states remains elusive. For optomechanical systems, the coupling to the environment was shown to make the detection of the mechanical mode occupation difficult, typically requiring the single-photon strong-coupling regime. Here, we propose and analyse an electromechanical setup, which allows us to overcome this limitation and resolve the energy levels of a mechanical oscillator. We found that the heating of the membrane, caused by the interaction with the environment and unwanted couplings, can be suppressed for carefully designed electromechanical systems. The results suggest that phonon number measurement is within reach for modern electromechanical setups.},

            Radiation pressure has recently been used to effectively couple the quantum motion of mechanical elements to the fields of optical or microwave light. Integration of all three degrees of freedom—mechanical, optical and microwave—would enable a quantum interconnect between microwave and optical quantum systems. We present a platform based on silicon nitride nanomembranes for integrating superconducting microwave circuits with planar acoustic and optical devices such as phononic and photonic crystals. Using planar capacitors with vacuum gaps of 60 nm and spiral inductor coils of micron pitch we realize microwave resonant circuits with large electromechanical coupling to planar acoustic structures of nanoscale dimensions and {femtoFarad} motional capacitance. Using this enhanced coupling, we demonstrate microwave backaction cooling of the 4.48 {MHz} mechanical resonance of a nanobeam to an occupancy as low as 0.32. These results indicate the viability of silicon nitride nanomembranes as an all-in-one substrate for quantum electro-opto-mechanical experiments.},

Mechanical systems provide sensitive and scalable architectures for sensing applications ranging from atomic force microscopy to gravity wave interferometry. Optical resonators driven by low noise lasers provide a quiet and well-understood means to read-out and manipulate mechanical motion, by way of the radiation pressure force. Taken to an extreme, a device consisting of a high-Q nanomechanical oscillator coupled to a high-ﬁnesse optical cavity may enable ground-state preparation of the mechanical element, thus paving the way for a new class of quantum technology based on chip-scale phononic devices coupled to optical photons.

	abstract = {Quantum vacuum fluctuations impose strict limits on precision displacement measurements, those of interferometric gravitational-wave detectors among them. Introducing squeezed states into an interferometer's readout port can improve the sensitivity of the instrument, leading to richer astrophysical observations. In recent years, this technique has been used to improve the sensitivity of the {GEO}600 [1011 and the Initial {LIGO} detector at Hanford, {WA} [102]. Squeezed states could be employed in advanced gravitational-wave detectors, such as Advanced {LIGO}, to further push the limits of the observable gravitational wave universe. To maximize the benefit from squeezing, environmentally induced disturbances such as back scattering and angular jitter need to be mitigated. Also, optomechanical interactions dictate that the quadrature of the squeezed vacuum state must rotate by 900 at around 50 Hz in order to achieve a broadband sensitivity improvement for Advanced {LIGO}. In this thesis we describe a series of experiments that lead to a ultra-high vacuum ({UHV}) compatible, low phase noise, and frequency-dependent squeezed vacuum source required for Advanced {LIGO} and future gravitational-wave detectors. In order to develop the required technology, two proof-of-principal experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, we built a {UHV} compatible squeezed vacuum source and homodyne readout and operated them in {UHV} conditions. We also commissioned a control scheme that achieved a record low 1.30-7 mrad of phase noise. This is a nearly tenfold improvement over previously reported measurements with audio-band squeezed vacuum sources. In the second experiment we used a 2-m-long, high-finesse optical resonator to produce frequency-dependent squeezed quadrature rotation around 1.2kHz. This demonstration of audio-band frequency-dependent squeezing uses technology and methods that are scalable to the required rotation frequency for Advance {LIGO}, firmly establishing the viability of this technique for application in current and future gravitational-wave detectors. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these results for squeezing enhancement in Advanced {LIGO} and beyond.},

	abstract = {Optical precision measurements have become one of the most important tools in physics to test the fundamental laws and to probe the universe around us. Often such experiments require high finesse cavities, and optical loss in these cavities is a critical parameter. In particular, for those cavities that deal with quantum systems, minimizing the cavity loss is crucial because any loss can easily degrade the fragile quantum states. One such example is a quantum noise filter cavity for gravitational wave ({GW}) detectors, where an optical cavity is necessary for producing frequency-dependent squeezed states of light to improve the sensitivity over their broad audioband frequency [1]. To test the feasibility of quantum noise filter cavities for {GW} detectors, we characterized the optical loss of state-of-the-art mirrors using a 2 m long high-finesse cavity. Using multiple loss measurement techniques, we studied loss dependence on laser beam sizes and positions. Within the 1 to 3 mm beam spot size we measured, we found that the mirror loss is almost constant at around 5 ppm, and that the loss depends more on the beam position on the mirror than on the beam size 121. While intra-cavity optical loss is one of the key parameters informing the design of quantum noise filter cavities, we also need to account for other quantum noise degradation mechanisms such as the phase noise, losses outside of the cavity, and mode-matching. We developed an analytical model of frequency-dependent squeezing with a quantum noise filter cavity to explore the practical degradation mechanisms in detail 131. Finally, by coupling a squeezed light source to the 2 m long high-finesse cavity, we demonstrated frequency-dependent squeezed states where 6 {dB} of squeezing in the squeezed quadrature was rotated by 90 degrees in the audio frequency band 141. The techniques used are directly applicable to squeezed light sources for {GW} detectors, and the measurements validated the model. The loss measurement results, the analytical model, and this demonstration, are now the basis for the design of a realistic quantum noise filter cavity for use in {GW} detectors in the near future to improve their sensitivity.},

The injection of conventional squeezed vacuum reduces quantum noise in one quadrature at the expense of increasing noise in the other. While this approach improved the sensitivity of the Advanced {LIGO} and Advanced Virgo interferometers during their third observing run (O3), future improvements in arm power and squeezing levels will bring radiation pressure noise to the forefront. Installation of a filter cavity for frequency-dependent squeezing provides broadband reduction of quantum noise through the mitigation of this radiation pressure noise, and it is the baseline approach planned for all of the future gravitational-wave detectors currently conceived. The design and operation of a filter cavity requires careful consideration of interferometer optomechanics as well as squeezing degradation processes. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis to determine the optimal operating point of a filter cavity. We use our model alongside numerical tools to study the implications for filter cavities to be installed in the upcoming “A+” upgrade of the Advanced {LIGO} detectors.},

The replacement of this ordinary vacuum field with a squeezed vacuum field has proven to be an effective strategy to mitigate such quantum noise and it is currently used in advanced detectors. However, current squeezing cannot improve the noise across the whole spectrum because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: when shot noise at high frequencies is reduced, radiation pressure at low frequencies is increased. A broadband quantum noise reduction is possible by using a more complex squeezing source, obtained by reflecting the squeezed vacuum off a Fabry-Perot cavity, known as filter cavity. Here we report the first demonstration of a frequency-dependent squeezed vacuum source able to reduce quantum noise of advanced gravitational-wave detectors in their whole observation bandwidth. The experiment uses a suspended 300-m-long filter cavity, similar to the one planned for {KAGRA}, Advanced Virgo, and Advanced {LIGO}, and capable of inducing a rotation of the squeezing ellipse below 100 Hz.},

The key property of a two-photon device is that it excites pairs of output modes independently. Thus our new formalism deals with two modes at a time; a continuum multimode description can be built by integrating over independently excited pairs of modes. For a pair of modes at frequencies Ω±ε, we define (i) quadrature-phase amplitudes, which are complex-amplitude operators for modulation at frequency ε of waves ‘‘cos[Ω(t-x/c)]’’ and ‘‘sin[Ω(t-x/c)]’’ and (ii) two-mode squeezed states, which are the output states of an ideal two-photon device. The quadrature-phase amplitudes and the two-mode squeezed states serve as the building blocks for our formalism; their properties and their physical interpretation are extensively investigated.},

	abstract = {This paper provides the mathematical foundation for the two-mode formalism introduced in the preceding paper. A vector notation is introduced; it allows two-mode properties to be written as compactly as the comparable properties for a single mode. The fundamental unitary operators of the formalism are described and their properties are examined; particular attention is paid to the two-mode squeeze operator. Special quantum states associated with the formalism are considered, with emphasis on the two-mode squeezed states.},

	abstract = {With the conclusion of the first two observing runs of the Advanced {LIGO} detectors, which saw the first direct detection of gravitational waves, we are firmly in the era of gravitational-wave astronomy. To reach the highest sensitivities, current interferometric gravitational-wave detectors are designed for hundreds of kilowatts of circulating optical power. At these high circulating powers, the sensitivity of the detectors to gravitational waves will be limited by the quantum properties of the light: shot noise at frequencies above {\textasciitilde} 100 Hz, and quantum radiation pressure noise at lower frequencies. To reach the high powers necessary for achieving the quantum noise limits imposed by the light, it is essential to solve the control problems and understand the additional noise introduced by high power operation. Additionally, development of high-power laser sources that reach the stringent noise and reliability requirements is crucial. This work comprises three experiments aimed at reaching the radiation-pressure-dominated regime of interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. The first part presents results from a high-power, meter-long Fabry-Prot Michelson interferometer to probe classical and quantum radiation pressure effects using a gram-scale mechanical oscillator. The second part is an exploration of the effects of electric fields and charging of test masses on the sensitivity of the {LIGO} detectors, which may limit the ability to observe radiation-pressure effects. Finally, we describe the development and characterization of a high-power, narrow-linewidth ytterbium-doped fiber amplifier for use in future gravitational-wave detectors.},

	title = {Quantum noise reduction using squeezed states in {LIGO}},
	abstract = {Direct detection of gravitational waves will require earth based detectors to measure strains of the order 10−21, at frequencies of 100 Hz, a sensitivity that has been accomplished with the initial generation of {LIGO} interferometric gravitational wave detectors. A new generation of detectors currently under construction is designed improve on the sensitivity of the initial detectors by about a factor of 10. The quantum nature of light will limit the sensitivity of these Advanced {LIGO} interferometers at most frequencies; new approaches to reducing the quantum noise will be needed to improve the sensitivity further. This quantum noise originates from the vacuum ﬂuctuations that enter the unused port of the interferometer and interfere with the laser light. Vacuum ﬂuctuations have the minimum noise allowed by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, ∆X1∆X2 ≥ 1, where the two quadratures X1 and X2 are non-commuting observables responsible for the two forms of quantum noise, shot noise and radiation pressure noise. By replacing the vacuum ﬂuctuations entering the interferometer with squeezed states, which have lower noise in one quadrature than the vacuum state, we have reduced the shot noise of a {LIGO} interferometer. The sensitivity to gravitational waves measured during this experiment represents the best sensitivity achieved to date at frequencies above 200 Hz, and possibly the ﬁrst time that squeezing has been measured in an interferometer at frequencies below 700 Hz. The possibility that injection of squeezed states could introduce environmental noise couplings that would degrade the crucial but fragile low frequency sensitivity of a {LIGO} interferometer has been a major concern in planning to implement squeezing as part of baseline interferometer operations. These results demonstrate that squeezing is compatible with the low frequency sensitivity of a full scale gravitational wave interferometer. We also investigated the limits to the level of squeezing observed, including optical losses and ﬂuctuations of the squeezing angle. The lessons learned should allow for responsible planning to implement squeezing in Advanced {LIGO}, either as an alternative to high power operation or an early upgrade to improve the sensitivity. This thesis is available at {DSpace}@{MIT} and has {LIGO} document number P1300006.},

	abstract = {The dawn of gravitational-wave astronomy has begun in 2015 with the historic detection of a binary black hole merger. Several more detections followed in the years after. Among them, the detectors observed the inspiral of a neutron star binary. This merger was also observed in a broad spectrum of electromagnetic counterparts. This multi-messenger observation demonstrated that gravitational-wave astronomy is invaluable for understanding the Universe. 
Current detectors, however, are able to see only a small part of binaries’ inspirals. A typical signal from an inspiral of a binary neutron star appears in the detector at low frequencies a few minutes before the merger. During the inspiral, the frequency of the signal increases, faster for higher frequencies. It quickly passes through the detection band of the observatory. The merger itself and post-merger oscillations often remain inaccessible due to the reduced sensitivity of the detector to high-frequency signals. An increase in the low-frequency sensitivity will allow to detect signals significantly earlier, extracting more information about the binary. This will allow to precisely locate the source on the sky for the follow-up multi-messenger observations. An increase in the high-frequency sensitivity will give a possibility to observe the merger and post-merger signals, gaining insight into the physics of ultra-dense quantum matter. 
The limitations to the sensitivity arise from quantum nature of light used to sense the displacement of mirrors caused by gravitational waves. At low frequencies, quantum fluctuations in the amplitude of the light field cause random forces on the mirrors, which mask the signal from gravitational waves. At high frequencies, quantum fluctuations in the phase of the light field cause measurement noise on the detectors. The detectors use optical cavities to enhance the signal within the bandwidth of the cavities. At frequencies outside this bandwidth the signal is getting suppressed. Signals from the binary neutron star mergers typically have frequencies outside the detection bandwidth. 
In this thesis I study the fundamental limitations on the sensitivity of detectors, in the quest of a broadband observatory. I discuss a speedmeter approach to increasing the low-frequency sensitivity, and propose two ways of achieving it: with quantum-entangled light, and in a novel ring cavity topology of the detector, which I test experimentally. I further study the fundamental limits arising from the finite bandwidth of the cavities, and demonstrate experimentally how this limit can be overcome. I propose a concept of quantum expander that allows to increase the detection bandwidth by using quantum correlations, generated directly inside the detector’s cavities. I investigate, how quantum correlations, controlled by internal squeezing, can help to tailor the sensitivity of the detector for the optimal performance at selected frequencies. Finally, I show that, although the benefit from application of squeezed light in metrology is limited by quantum decoherence, its impact on the sensitivity can be reduced by exploiting quantum correlations created with internal squeezing. 
Quantum nature of light is a nuisance, which prevents us from seeing gravitational waves, but also a powerful tool, if properly applied. Quantum correlations hidden in the noise can be exploited for the benefit of the detectors, as I show in various scenarios throughout the thesis. 
Quantum noise can be tamed, and not only in gravitational-wave detectors. All cavity-enhanced quantum metrological experiments can use quantum noise and underlying correlations as the resource for tailoring their sensitivity.},

In the electromagnetic case, we show that the quantization of electromagnetic radiation (which causes decoherence of Alice's particle) and vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field (which limits Bob's ability to localize his particle to better than a charge-radius) both are essential for avoiding apparent paradoxes with causality and complementarity. We then analyze the gravitational version of this gedankenexperiment. We correct an error in the analysis of Mari et al. and of Baym and Ozawa, who did not properly account for the conservation of center of mass of an isolated system. We show that the analysis of the gravitational case is in complete parallel with the electromagnetic case provided that gravitational radiation is quantized and that vacuum fluctuations limit the localization of a particle to no better than a Planck length. This provides support for the view that (linearized) gravity should have a quantum field description.},

	abstract = {This thesis describes the conception and construction of an “entanglement-enhanced” trapped atom clock on an atom chip ({TACC}). The key feature of this new experiment is the integration of two optical Fabry-Pérot micro resonators which enable generation of spin-squeezed states of the atomic ensemble via atom-light interactions and non-destructive detection of the atomic state. It has been shown before that spin-squeezed states can enhance the metrological performance of atomic clocks, but existing proof-of-principle experiments have not yet reached a metrologically relevant level of precision. This is the first goal of the new setup. To retain the compactness and stability of our setup, we chose the optical resonator to be a fiber Fabry-Pérot ({FFP}) resonator where the resonator mirrors are realized on the tip of optical fibers. To meet the requirements of our experiment, a new generation of {FFP} resonators was developed in the context of this thesis, demonstrating the longest {FFP} resonators to date. For this purpose, we developed a “dot milling” procedure using a focused {CO}2-laser that allows shaping of fused silica surfaces with unprecedented precision and versatility. Incorporating optical resonators in the {TACC} system requires a new atom chip design, allowing transportation of the atom cloud into the resonator. We present the design and the fabrication of this atom chip. The completed setup will enable investigations of the interplay of spin-dynamics in presence of light mediated correlations and spin-squeezing at a metrologically relevant stability level of 10⁻¹³ at 1 s.},

À cette fin, nous avons construit une plateforme où des atomes froids sont fortement couplés à une microcavité optique fibrée, sous un microscope de gaz quantique. Piégés dans un réseau à 1560nm, les atomes ont un couplage fort et homogène à la sonde à 780nm. Celui-ci permet leur interaction cohérente avec la cavité, malgré la forte hétérogénéité en fréquence induite par le piège. C'est la première observation d’un effet de protection par la cavité avec moins de 200 émetteurs. Nous mesurons le couplage croissant des états noirs à la cavité à mesure que le désordre l'emporte sur l'interaction collective. Dans le régime protégé nous démontrons la modulation en fréquence des polaritons, via la fréquence atomique. Ensuite, nous mettons en place des pinces optiques dans la microcavité, pour générer et manipuler plusieurs atomes uniques. La cavité permet la détection rapide et non destructive d'un atome unique dans une pince. Par une mesure du doublet de Rabi,  nous démontrons son couplage fort à la cavité, avec une coopérativité effective de 30. Pour finir, nous obtenons des atomes uniques dans une chaine de 9 pinces. Ce travail conduira à la manipulation de plusieurs atomes individuels, fortement couplés à la cavité, avec des applications en métrologie quantique multiparamètre, mettant à profit des états intriqués spatialement étendus et localement mesurables, et la simulation quantique d'une chaine de spins adressables, avec des interactions de portée infinie via la cavité.},

Pour un puits quantique dans une micro-cavité fibrée, le couplage obtenu est comparable a celui observé dans des structures intégrées et permet d'étudier plusieurs aspects de la physique des polaritons confinés optiquement. Ces derniers, issus du couplage fort d'un exciton et d'un photon, possèdent un temps de vie relativement long qui permet d'étudier les propriétés thermodynamiques du système. Le rôle du désordre dans le puits quantique est explicité. Cela nous permet d'interpréter la non-linéarité de la photoluminescence des polaritons avec la puissance de pompe en termes de transition de Dicke. Enfin, le confinement optique des polaritons, permet d'étudier le rôle des interactions entre polaritons et ouvre la voie vers un régime de blocage quantique de polariton.},

Le refroidissement et le taux de pertes par collisions assistées par la lumière dans le piège dipolaire sont augmentés via une modulation de l’intensité du faisceau dipolaire dont l’effet sur la durée de vie de l’atome est expliqué. Une source fibrée de photons uniques à la demande est obtenue avec ce dispositif, produisant des photons dans un mode spatial et temporel à priori bien défini. Dans un second temps, nous présentons la conception d’une expérience couplant optimalement une chaîne d’atomes uniques piégés à une cavité Fabry-Pérot fibrée combinée avec une lentille à forte ouverture numérique pour imager et adresser les atomes individuellement. Un dispositif d’ablation laser de précision submicrométrique est alors construit pour réaliser et analyser in situ les formes de miroirs voulues à l’extrémité des fibres optiques. Nous présentons ensuite les cavités fibrées doublement résonantes avec une biréfringence contrôlée réalisées. Nous décrivons également le système expérimental construit pour la production rapide d’un nuage d’atomes froids et leur transport vers la cavité.},

	abstract = {Bulk acoustic wave ({BAW}) resonators are attractive as intermediaries in a microwave-to-optical transducer, due to their long coherence times and controllable coupling to optical photons and superconducting qubits. However, for an optomechanical transducer to operate without detrimental added noise, the mechanical modes must be in the quantum ground state. This has proven challenging in recent demonstrations of transduction based on other types of mechanical resonators, where absorption of laser light caused heating of the phonon modes. In this work, we demonstrate ground-state operation of a Brillouin optomechanical system composed of a quartz {BAW} resonator inside an optical cavity. We show optomechanical coupling to several phonon modes and perform sideband asymmetry thermometry to demonstrate a thermal occupation below 0.5 phonons at base temperature. This constitutes the heaviest (∼494µ⁢g) mechanical object measured in the quantum ground state to date. Further measurements confirm a negligible effect of laser heating on this phonon occupation. Our results pave the way toward low-noise, high-efficiency microwave-to-optical transduction based on {BAW} resonators.},

By employing lithium triborate-based resonant cavity with moderate finesse, we propose an approach for generating efficient SHG in the visible and ultraviolet spectral ranges without requiring an active electronic servo loop. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate frequency doubling of a high-power 1064\&\#x00A0;nm laser to 532\&\#x00A0;nm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of such a cavity featuring a highly reflective coating on one end of this crystal. This quasi-monolithic design enables simultaneous control of phase matching and cavity resonance solely through temperature adjustment of the nonlinear crystal.},

	abstract = {We theoretically study an optomechanical system which consists of a two-sided cavity and a mechanical membrane that is placed outside of it. The membrane is positioned close to one of its mirrors, and the cavity is coupled to the external light field through the other mirror. Our study is focused on the regime where the dispersive optomechanical coupling in the system vanishes. Such a regime is found to be possible if the membrane is less reflecting than the adjacent mirror, yielding a potentially very strong dissipative optomechanical coupling. Specifically, if the absolute values of amplitude transmission coefficients of the membrane and the mirror, 𝑡 and 𝑡𝑚, respectively, obey the condition 𝑡2𝑚{\textless}𝑡≪𝑡𝑚≪1, the dissipative coupling constant of the setup exceeds the dispersive coupling constant for an optomechanical cavity of the same length. The dissipative coupling constant and the corresponding optomechanical cooperativity of the proposed system are also compared with those of the Michelson-Sagnac interferometer and the so-called “membrane-at-the-edge” system, which are known for a strong optomechanical dissipative interaction. It is shown that under the above condition, the system proposed here is advantageous in both aspects. It also enables an efficient realization of the two-port configuration, which was recently proposed as a promising optomechanical system, providing, among other benefits, a possibility of quantum limited optomechanical measurements in a system which does not suffer from any optomechanical instability.},

Work towards this goal has focused on increasing the strength of the coupling between the mechanical and optical degrees of freedom. However, the form of this coupling is crucial in determining which phenomena can be observed in such a system. Here we demonstrate that avoided crossings in the spectrum of an optical cavity containing a flexible dielectric membrane enable us to realize several different forms of the optomechanical coupling. These include cavity detunings that are (to lowest order) linear, quadratic or quartic in the membrane’s displacement, and a cavity finesse that is linear in (or independent of) the membrane’s displacement. All these couplings are realized in a single device with extremely low optical loss and can be tuned over a wide range in situ. In particular, we find that the quadratic coupling can be increased three orders of magnitude beyond previous devices. As a result of these advances, the device presented here should be capable of demonstrating the quantization of the membrane’s mechanical energy.},

abstract = {The development of hybrid quantum systems provides a flexibility that allows for various components to be coupled together, thereby expanding the opportunity to build quantum sensors and devices that can be designed for specific purposes. Key to doing so is being able to strongly couple the different components. Most developments to date have relied on the components being in close proximity, which can hamper design flexibility. Karg et al. used a laser to induce strong coupling between a cloud of atoms and an optomechanical membrane. With the components separated by 1 meter, this approach demonstrates a methodology of coupling quantum systems and easing up restrictions on spatial proximity. Science, this issue p. 174 Laser light is used to strongly couple different quantum systems that are more than 1 meter apart. Engineering strong interactions between quantum systems is essential for many phenomena of quantum physics and technology. Typically, strong coupling relies on short-range forces or on placing the systems in high-quality electromagnetic resonators, which restricts the range of the coupling to small distances. We used a free-space laser beam to strongly couple a collective atomic spin and a micromechanical membrane over a distance of 1 meter in a room-temperature environment. The coupling is highly tunable and allows the observation of normal-mode splitting, coherent energy exchange oscillations, two-mode thermal noise squeezing, and dissipative coupling. Our approach to engineering coherent long-distance interactions with light makes it possible to couple very different systems in a modular way, opening up a range of opportunities for quantum control and coherent feedback networks.}

abstract = {Many protocols in quantum science and technology require initializing a system in a pure quantum state. In the context of the motional state of massive resonators, this enables studying fundamental physics at the elusive quantum--classical transition, and measuring force and acceleration with enhanced sensitivity. Laser cooling has been a method of choice to prepare mechanical resonators in the quantum ground state, one of the simplest pure states. However, to overcome the heating and decoherence by the thermal bath, this usually has to be combined with cryogenic cooling. Here, we laser-cool an ultracoherent, soft-clamped mechanical resonator close to the quantum ground state directly from room temperature. To this end, we implement the versatile membrane-in-the-middle setup with one fiber mirror and one phononic crystal mirror, which reaches a quantum cooperativity close to unity already at room temperature. We furthermore introduce a powerful combination of coherent and measurement-based quantum control techniques, which allows us to mitigate thermal intermodulation noise. The lowest occupancy we reach is 30 phonons, limited by measurement imprecision. Doing away with the necessity for cryogenic cooling should further facilitate the spread of optomechanical quantum technologies.},

In this work, we show that quantum correlated light can improve the performance of such sensors, increasing both their sensitivity and their bandwidth. Specifically, we develop a silicon-chip-based cavity optomechanical magnetometer that incorporates phase squeezed light to suppress optical shot noise. At frequencies where shot noise is the dominant noise source, this allows a 20\% improvement in magnetic field sensitivity. Furthermore, squeezed light broadens the range of frequencies at which thermal noise dominates, which has the effect of increasing the overall sensor bandwidth by 50\%. These proof-of-principle results open the door to apply quantum correlated light more broadly in chip-scale sensors and devices.},

               Glotin, Fran{\c c}ois and Lartaux-Vollard, Ang{\'e}lique and

  abstract  = "Abstract The implementation of Fabry--Perot cavities in
               gravitational-wave detectors has been pivotal to improving their
               sensitivity, allowing the observation of an increasing number of
               cosmological events with higher signal-to-noise ratio. Notably,
               Fabry--Perot cavities play a key role in the frequency-dependent
               squeezing technique, which provides a reduction of quantum noise
               over the whole observation frequency spectrum. In this paper, we
               first present how the adaptability of resonance properties of
               linear three-mirror cavities, and the real-time control we could
               have on it, would be interesting for frequency-dependant
               squeezing in future detectors, especially for Einstein Telescope
               project. In this view, we develop a complete model to describe
               the stability behavior and the properties of transmitted and
               reflected fields of a linear three-mirror cavity aiming to be
               used for design purposes. In particular, simulations are carried
               out to show the evolution of the characteristic double resonance
               peak they can show-off, which is one of the key features of this
               system, as a function of cavity parameters. We show that the
               double-peak shape is almost freely adjustable, either in terms
               of spacing between maxima, their relative amplitude and
               intrinsic width. This is made possible by changing the mirrors'
               reflectivity coefficients and the sub-cavities
               microscopic/macroscopic lengths. However, the amount of
               achievable realistic configurations is limited by the stability
               conditions of the cavity. In particular, if the two sub-cavities
               do not have the same macroscopic length, it could be difficult
               to obtain a stable three-mirror cavity. Different geometries
               have been studied to obtain a stable system.",

               that range from protein mass spectrometry and magnetic resonance
               force microscopy to quantum optomechanics. A notorious challenge
               in these experiments is the thermomechanical noise related to
               the dissipation through internal or external loss channels. Here
               we introduce a novel approach to define the nanomechanical
               modes, which simultaneously provides a strong spatial
               confinement, full isolation from the substrate and dilution of
               the resonator material's intrinsic dissipation by five orders of
               magnitude. It is based on a phononic bandgap structure that
               localizes the mode but does not impose the boundary conditions
               of a rigid clamp. The reduced curvature in the highly tensioned
               silicon nitride resonator enables a mechanical Q > 108 at 1 MHz
               to yield the highest mechanical Qf products (>1014 Hz) yet
               reported at room temperature.The corresponding coherence times
               approach those of optically trapped dielectric particles.

  abstract  = "Material absorption is a key limitation in nanophotonic systems;
               however, its characterization is often obscured by scattering
               and diffraction. Here we show that nanomechanical frequency
               spectroscopy can be used to characterize material absorption at
               the parts per million level and use it to characterize the
               extinction coefficient $\kappa$ of stoichiometric silicon
               nitride (Si3N4). Specifically, we track the frequency shift of a
               high-Q Si3N4 trampoline in response to laser photothermal
               heating and infer $\kappa$ from a model including stress
               relaxation and both conductive and radiative heat transfer. A
               key insight is the presence of two thermalization time scales:
               rapid radiative cooling of the Si3N4 film and slow parasitic
               heating of the Si chip. We infer $\kappa$ ∼ 0.1-1 ppm for Si3N4
               in the 532-1550 nm wavelength range, matching bounds set by
               waveguide resonators. Our approach is applicable to diverse

               to enhance their sensitivities through the concomitant reduction

               heat conduction becomes less efficient at low temperatures,
               which renders difficult to ensure and verify their proper

               networking14-16. Although atom losses typically limit these

               substantially enhance cycle rates, remove bottlenecks in
               metrology23 and enable deep-circuit quantum evolution through
               quantum error correction24,25. Here we demonstrate an

               operation of a large-scale atom-array system while realizing
               coherent storage and manipulation of quantum information. Our

               preserving the quantum state of stored qubits. Our results pave

We show that when the energy difference between the optical modes dominates (i.e., in the adiabatic limit) this system generically realizes a dissipative optomechanical coupling, with an effective position-dependent photonic damping rate. The resulting quantum noise interference can be used to ground-state cool a mechanical resonator in the unresolved sideband regime. We explicitly demonstrate how quantum noise interference controls linear backaction effects and show that this interference persists even outside the adiabatic limit. For a one-port cavity in the extreme bad cavity limit, the interference allows one to cancel all linear backaction effects. This allows continuous measurements of position-squared, with no stringent constraints on the single-photon optomechanical coupling strength. In contrast, such a complete cancellation is not possible in the good cavity limit. This places strict bounds on the optomechanical coupling required for quantum nondemolition measurements of mechanical energy, even in a one-port device.},

In the case of interferometric displacement measurements, these restrictions impose a standard quantum limit ({SQL}), which optimally balances the precision of a measurement with its unwanted backaction1. To go beyond this limit, one must devise more sophisticated measurement techniques, which either ‘evade’ the backaction of the measurement2 or achieve clever cancellation of the unwanted noise at the detector3,4. In the half-century since the {SQL} was established, systems ranging from {LIGO}5 to ultracold atoms6 and nanomechanical devices7,8 have pushed displacement measurements towards this limit, and a variety of sub-{SQL} techniques have been tested in proof-of-principle experiments9–13. However, so far, no experimental system has successfully demonstrated an interferometric displacement measurement with sensitivity (including all relevant noise sources—thermal, backaction and imprecision) below the {SQL}. Here, we exploit strong quantum correlations in an ultracoherent optomechanical system to demonstrate off-resonant force and displacement sensitivity reaching 1.5 {dB} below the {SQL}. This achieves an outstanding goal in mechanical quantum sensing and further enhances the prospects of using such devices for state-of-the-art force sensing applications.},

	abstract = {Gravitational-wave detectors like Advanced {LIGO} probe perhaps the most cataclysmic events since the Big Bang, involving objects tens to hundreds of times more massive than the Sun, yet they remain at the whim of minute quantum fluctuations. Pushing our reach further into the cosmos demands a mastery over these quantum effects. In recent years, we have entered the era of quantum-enhanced gravitational-wave detection, wherein the injection of squeezed states has been demonstrated as an effective technique to suppress high-frequency vacuum fluctuations. As gravitational-wave detectors continue to improve, operating at higher powers with more squeezing and reduced classical noises, radiation pressure noise is increasingly becoming a limiting factor at low frequencies. Frequency-dependent squeezed sources circumvent this by appropriately rotating the quadrature of the injected squeezing so as to confer sensitivity improvements across the entirety of the gravitational-wave detection band.

In this thesis, we study the use of frequency-dependent squeezing in gravitational-wave detectors. We offer the first demonstration of a frequency-dependent squeezed source operating at frequencies useful for gravitational-wave detectors. To achieve this, we commissioned and operated a long, extremely-high-finesse optical cavity to a high degree of stability, compatible with the stringent requirements called for by the next iteration of {LIGO}: Advanced {LIGO}+.

At the same time, gravitational-wave detectors are just now reaching the sensitivities required to observe quantum effects on the kilogram-scale of the test masses. We use the superb displacement precision of Advanced {LIGO} to suppress the differential motion of the test masses to within 10\% of the ground state.},

	abstract = {Multimode quantum light fields have emerged as a promising tool for the generation of multipartite entangled states, known as cluster states, and the advancement of continuous-variable ({CV})-based quantum information technologies. In our approach, the nodes of the entangled network represent individual temporal/frequency modes of the electromagnetic field, while the links are tailored entanglement correlations. In this thesis we demonstrate the generation of multimode squeezed states that are multiplexed both in the temporal and in the spectral domain. Our setup is based on a train of ultrashort pulses that drive a spontaneous parametric down conversion process in a non-linear periodically poled {KTP} waveguide. Here, we produced the largest number of spectral modes of squeezed vacuum measured via homodyne detection in a single-pass configuration. Moreover, we performed pulse-resolved (pulse-by-pulse) squeezing measurements, confirming the existence of the multimode spectral structure at a single pulse level; this paves the for generating entangled structures at the repetition rate of the laser. While temporal multiplexing has already enabled the generation of the largest {CV}-cluster states, multimode squeezing in the spectral modes of a femtosecond source provides complete reconfigurability of the entanglement network. In addition to the generation of multiplexed entangled networks, this thesis explores other types of quantum information processing applications for multimode squeezed light. The high number of pulsed modes allows us to implement quantum walks on a graph for search purposes, analogously to the Grover algorithm. Multimode squeezed light has also been exploited in this work to investigate the field of quantum simulations, and in particular to observe the emergence of quantum synchronization effects.},

	abstract = {Quantum noise is one of the limiting factors in laser-interferometric gravitational-wave ({GW}) detectors. The application of squeezed states in these interferometers allows the reduction of quantum noise in one quadrature. Due to opto-mechanical coupling in a {GW} detector the squeezed quadrature needs to be rotated within the spectrum to achieve a broadband noise reduction. So far, the implementation of additional filter cavities is considered that allow for the optimal, frequency-dependent rotation of the squeezed quadrature. However, these cavities need to have low loss, a length in the order of {\textbackslash}unit[100]\{m\} and must be situated in the vacuum system, making them cost-intensive. In 2017, Ma and coworkers proposed a scheme for the broadband quantum-noise reduction without the need of additional filter cavities. It was shown by Brown et al. that a similar scheme can be used to broadband-enhance interferometers with a detuned signal-recycling cavity. Here, we performed a proof-of-principle experiment of the proposal on a table-top-scale. Squeezed states were produced detuned to the carrier field of a {\textbackslash}unit[2.5]\{m\}-linear cavity and read out in a bichromatic homodyne detection. The frequencies of the lower and upper local oscillator were at entangled sidebands of the squeezed field. Depending on the relations between the involved frequencies, we can address both variants of the proposal. We show, that the frequency-dependences of the resulting noise spectra fit to a theoretical model we derived from the theory used by Ma et al. With this work we set the path towards an implementation of these schemes in a {GW}-detector prototype, where the compatibility of the approach with a low-frequency suspended interferometer can be tested. Moreover, we used the same setup to show nonclassical interferometer enhancement at low frequencies by high-frequency squeezed states. Here, a heterodyne readout scheme was implemented to avoid limiting noises at low frequencies. The application of squeezed states centered around the local oscillator frequency yielded an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of \${\textbackslash}unit[3.4]\{{dB}\}{\textbackslash}pm{\textbackslash}unit[0.3]\{{dB}\}\$. Additionally, I designed, built and characterized a compact source of squeezed vacuum-states at {\textbackslash}unit[1064]\{nm\} with a footprint of just \${\textbackslash}unit[0.8]\{m{\textasciicircum}2\}\$. I show measurements of squeezed states from this source with a reduction of quantum noise of \${\textbackslash}unit[10.7]\{{dB}\}{\textbackslash}pm{\textbackslash}unit[0.2]\{{dB}\}\$ below the vacuum noise and present a noise reduction in the frequency range from {\textbackslash}unit[70]\{{kHz}\} to {\textbackslash}unit[65]\{{MHz}\}.},

We consider the special case of a set of two coupled resonators and derive the coupled rate equations for the fields in each of the two cavities with coupling coefficients. The resulting formulas are both simpler than those derived from coupled-mode theory and more accurate in the sense that they give a steady-state response which agrees with that calculated from the composite cavity modes.

Techniques considered include injection and generation of non-classical (squeezed) states of light, and cooling and trapping of macroscopic mirror degrees of freedom by manipulation of the optomechanical coupling between radiation pressure and mirror motion. A computational tool is developed to model complex optomechanical systems in which these effects arise. The simulation tool is used to design an apparatus capable of demonstrating a variety of radiation pressure effects, most notably ponderomotive squeezing and the optical spring effect. A series of experiments were performed, designed to approach measurement of these effects. The experiments use a 1 gram mirror to show progressively stronger radiation pressure effects, but only in the classical regime. The most significant result of these experiments is that we use radiation pressure from two" optical fields to shift the mechanical resonant frequency of a suspended mirror from 172 Hz to 1.8 {kHz}, while simultaneously damping its motion. The technique could prove useful in advanced gravitational wave interferometers by easing control issues, and also has the side effect of effectively cooling the mirror by removing its thermal energy. We show that with improvements, the technique may allow the quantum ground state of the mirror to be approached. Finally, we discuss future prospects for approaching quantum effects in the experiments.},
