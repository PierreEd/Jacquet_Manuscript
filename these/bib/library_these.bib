Such resonators sustain vibration modes in the megahertz range with quality factors of a few thousand. Thanks to a two-dimensional square lattice of holes, their reflectivity at normal incidence at 1064 nm reaches values as high as 95%. These two features, combined with the very low mass of the membrane, open the way to the use of such periodic structures as deformable end mirrors in Fabry-Perot cavities for the investigation of cavity optomechanical effects.},

   abstract = {Recent table-top optical interferometry experiments and advances in gravitational-wave detectors have demonstrated the capability of optical interferometry to detect displacements with high sensitivity. Operation at higher powers will be crucial for further sensitivity enhancement, but dynamical effects caused by radiation pressure on the interferometer mirrors must be taken into account, and the appearance of optomechanical instabilities may jeopardize the stable operation of the next generation of interferometers. These instabilities are the result of a nonlinear coupling between the motion of the mirrors and the optical field, which modifies the effective dynamics of the mirror. Such 'optical spring' effects have already been demonstrated for the mechanical damping of an electromagnetic waveguide with a moving wall, the resonance frequency of a specially designed flexure oscillator, and the optomechanical instability of a silica microtoroidal resonator. Here we present an experiment where a micromechanical resonator is used as a mirror in a very high-finesse optical cavity, and its displacements are monitored with unprecedented sensitivity. By detuning the laser frequency with respect to the cavity resonance, we have observed a drastic cooling of the microresonator by intracavity radiation pressure, down to an effective temperature of 10 kelvin. For opposite detuning, efficient heating is observed, as well as a radiation-pressure-induced instability of the resonator. Further experimental progress and cryogenic operation may lead to the experimental observation of the quantum ground state of a micromechanical resonator, either by passive or active cooling techniques.},

   abstract = {The simple mechanical oscillator, canonically consisting of a coupled mass-spring system, is used in a wide variety of sensitive measurements, including the detection of weak forces and small masses. On the one hand, a classical oscillator has a well-defined amplitude of motion; a quantum oscillator, on the other hand, has a lowest-energy state, or ground state, with a finite-amplitude uncertainty corresponding to zero-point motion. On the macroscopic scale of our everyday experience, owing to interactions with its highly fluctuating thermal environment a mechanical oscillator is filled with many energy quanta and its quantum nature is all but hidden. Recently, in experiments performed at temperatures of a few hundredths of a kelvin, engineered nanomechanical resonators coupled to electrical circuits have been measured to be oscillating in their quantum ground state. These experiments, in addition to providing a glimpse into the underlying quantum behaviour of mesoscopic systems consisting of billions of atoms, represent the initial steps towards the use of mechanical devices as tools for quantum metrology or as a means of coupling hybrid quantum systems. Here we report the development of a coupled, nanoscale optical and mechanical resonator formed in a silicon microchip, in which radiation pressure from a laser is used to cool the mechanical motion down to its quantum ground state (reaching an average phonon occupancy number of 0.85 ± 0.08). This cooling is realized at an environmental temperature of 20 K, roughly one thousand times larger than in previous experiments and paves the way for optical control of mesoscale mechanical oscillators in the quantum regime.},

   abstract = {Coherent interaction of laser radiation with multilevel atoms and molecules can lead to quantum interference in the electronic excitation pathways. A prominent example observed in atomic three-level-systems is the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), in which a control laser induces a narrow spectral transparency window for a weak probe laser beam. The concomitant rapid variation of the refractive index in this spectral window can give rise to dramatic reduction of the group velocity of a propagating pulse of probe light. Dynamic control of EIT via the control laser enables even a complete stop, that is, storage, of probe light pulses in the atomic medium. Here, we demonstrate optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT)--formally equivalent to EIT--in a cavity optomechanical system operating in the resolved sideband regime. A control laser tuned to the lower motional sideband of the cavity resonance induces a dipole-like interaction of optical and mechanical degrees of freedom. Under these conditions, the destructive interference of excitation pathways for an intracavity probe field gives rise to a window of transparency when a two-photon resonance condition is met. As a salient feature of EIT, the power of the control laser determines the width and depth of the probe transparency window. OMIT could therefore provide a new approach for delaying, slowing and storing light pulses in long-lived mechanical excitations of optomechanical systems, whose optical and mechanical properties can be tailored in almost arbitrary ways in the micro- and nano-optomechanical platforms developed to date.},

   abstract = {The sensitivity in interferometric measurements such as gravitational-wave detectors is ultimately limited by quantum noise of light. We discuss the use of feedback mechanisms to reduce the quantum effects of radiation pressure. Recent experiments have shown that it is possible to reduce the thermal motion of a mirror by cold damping. The mirror motion is measured with an optomechanical sensor based on a high-finesse cavity, and reduced by a feedback loop. We show that this technique can be extended to lock the mirror at the quantum level. In gravitational-waves interferometers with Fabry-Perot cavities in each arms, it is even possible to use a single feedback mechanism to lock one cavity mirror on the other. This quantum locking greatly improves the sensitivity of the interferometric measurement. It is furthermore insensitive to imperfections such as losses in the interferometer.},

   abstract = {Optical laser fields have been widely used to achieve quantum control over the motional and internal degrees of freedom of atoms and ions, molecules and atomic gases. A route to controlling the quantum states of macroscopic mechanical oscillators in a similar fashion is to exploit the parametric coupling between optical and mechanical degrees of freedom through radiation pressure in suitably engineered optical cavities. If the optomechanical coupling is 'quantum coherent'--that is, if the coherent coupling rate exceeds both the optical and the mechanical decoherence rate--quantum states are transferred from the optical field to the mechanical oscillator and vice versa. This transfer allows control of the mechanical oscillator state using the wide range of available quantum optical techniques. So far, however, quantum-coherent coupling of micromechanical oscillators has only been achieved using microwave fields at millikelvin temperatures. Optical experiments have not attained this regime owing to the large mechanical decoherence rates and the difficulty of overcoming optical dissipation. Here we achieve quantum-coherent coupling between optical photons and a micromechanical oscillator. Simultaneously, coupling to the cold photon bath cools the mechanical oscillator to an average occupancy of 1.7 ± 0.1 motional quanta. Excitation with weak classical light pulses reveals the exchange of energy between the optical light field and the micromechanical oscillator in the time domain at the level of less than one quantum on average. This optomechanical system establishes an efficient quantum interface between mechanical oscillators and optical photons, which can provide decoherence-free transport of quantum states through optical fibres. Our results offer a route towards the use of mechanical oscillators as quantum transducers or in microwave-to-optical quantum links.},

This single figure of merit removes the ambiguity in the frequently quoted coupling parameter defining the frequency shift for a given mechanical displacement, and the effective mass of the mechanical mode. Here we demonstrate and verify a straightforward experimental technique to derive the vacuum optomechanical coupling rate. It only requires applying a known frequency modulation of the employed electromagnetic probe field and knowledge of the mechanical oscillator’s occupation. The method is experimentally verified for a micromechanical mode in a toroidal whispering-gallery-resonator and a nanomechanical oscillator coupled to a toroidal cavity via its near field.},

   abstract = {En mécanique quantique, toute mesure est responsable d'une action en retour sur le système mesuré, qui limite en général la sensibilité de la mesure. Il en est ainsi dans les mesures interférométriques, où les miroirs de l'interféromètre sont susceptibles de se déplacer sous l'effet de la pression de radiation exercée par la lumière. Nous présentons une expérience visant à mettre en évidence ces limites, basée sur la détection ultra-sensible des déplacements d'un miroir mobile inséré dans une cavité Fabry-Perot de très grande finesse. Grâce aux améliorations que nous avons apportées à ce dispositif, nous avons observé des corrélations entre un bruit classique d'intensité et la phase de faisceaux lumineux, induites par couplage optomécanique avec le miroir mobile. Nous décrivons les conditions expérimentales nécessaires pour prolonger ces expériences au niveau quantique, afin d'observer les corrélations optomécaniques produites par les fluctuations quantiques de la pression de radiation, mais aussi pour réaliser une mesure quantique non destructive de la lumière par des moyens purement mécaniques. Nous présentons également plusieurs conséquences de la pression de radiation que notre montage nous a permis de mettre en évidence : annulation de l'action en retour dans les mesures de longueur ou de force, refroidissement laser du miroir dans une cavité désaccordée, et enfin un effet dynamique de l'action en retour qui conduit à l'amplification d'un signal par la mise en mouvement du miroir. Cet effet, prédit dans le cadre de la détection interférométrique des ondes gravitationnelles, devrait permettre d'améliorer la sensibilité au-delà de la limite quantique standard, qui devrait être atteinte dans les antennes gravitationnelles de seconde génération.},

   abstract = {Vertical Fabry Perot cavities (VFPC) have been extensively studied, especially for the realization of vertical-cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs). They are traditionally composed of two Distributed Bragg Reflectors (DBR) which reflectivity has to be sufficient in order to obtain highly resonant cavity, which is particularly necessary for laser emission in VCSELs. As a consequence, DBRs consist generally in very thick layer stacks. In this paper, we demonstrate the smallest conceivable high Q vertical Fabry-Perot cavity, using ultra-thin and highly-efficient photonic crystal slab mirrors instead of conventional DBRs, which enable moreover a control of the polarization.},

An entangled state of a system consisting of two subsystems cannot be described as a product of the quantum states of the two subsystems. In this sense, the entangled system is considered inseparable and non-local. It is generally believed that entanglement is usually manifest in systems consisting of a small number of microscopic particles. Here we demonstrate experimentally the entanglement of two macroscopic objects, each consisting of a caesium gas sample containing about 1012 atoms. Entanglement is generated via interaction of the samples with a pulse of light, which performs a non-local Bell measurement on the collective spins of the samples. The entangled spin-state can be maintained for 0.5 milliseconds. Besides being of fundamental interest, we expect the robust and long-lived entanglement of material objects demonstrated here to be useful in quantum information processing, including teleportation of quantum states of matter and quantum memory.},

   abstract = {The reaction of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate (gl) with NAD+ and NADP+ has been studied with stopped-flow techniques. The enzyme was in all experiments present in excess of the coenzyme. The results indicate that the ternary complex (E-NAD(P)H-kg) is present as an intermediate in the formation of the stable complex (E-NAD(P)H-gl). The identification of the complexes is based on their absorption spectra. The binding of the coenzyme to (E-gl) is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) while the dissociation of alpha-ketoglutarate (kg) from this complex is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl). The Km for glutamate was 20-25 mM in the first reaction and 3 mM in the formation of the stable complex. The Km values were independent of the coenzyme. The reaction rates with NAD+ were approximately 50% greater than those with NADP+. Furthermore, high glutamate concentration inhibited the formation of (E-NADH-kg) while no substrate inhibition was found with NADP+ as coenzyme. ADP enhanced while GTP reduced the rate of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) formation. The rate of formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) was inhibited by ADP, while it increased at high glutamate concentration when small amounts of GTP were added. The results show that the higher activity found with NAD+ compared to NADP+ under steady-state assay conditions do not necessarily involve binding of NAD+ to the ADP activating site of the enzyme. Moreover, the substrate inhibition found at high glutamate concentration under steady-state assay condition is not due to the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) as this complex is formed with Km of 3 mM glutamate, and the substrate inhibition is only significant at 20-30 times this concentration.},

   abstract = {Quantum mechanics provides a highly accurate description of a wide variety of physical systems. However, a demonstration that quantum mechanics applies equally to macroscopic mechanical systems has been a long-standing challenge, hindered by the difficulty of cooling a mechanical mode to its quantum ground state. The temperatures required are typically far below those attainable with standard cryogenic methods, so significant effort has been devoted to developing alternative cooling techniques. Once in the ground state, quantum-limited measurements must then be demonstrated. Here, using conventional cryogenic refrigeration, we show that we can cool a mechanical mode to its quantum ground state by using a microwave-frequency mechanical oscillator-a 'quantum drum'-coupled to a quantum bit, which is used to measure the quantum state of the resonator. We further show that we can controllably create single quantum excitations (phonons) in the resonator, thus taking the first steps to complete quantum control of a mechanical system.},

   abstract = {The advent of laser cooling techniques revolutionized the study of many atomic-scale systems, fuelling progress towards quantum computing with trapped ions and generating new states of matter with Bose-Einstein condensates. Analogous cooling techniques can provide a general and flexible method of preparing macroscopic objects in their motional ground state. Cavity optomechanical or electromechanical systems achieve sideband cooling through the strong interaction between light and motion. However, entering the quantum regime--in which a system has less than a single quantum of motion--has been difficult because sideband cooling has not sufficiently overwhelmed the coupling of low-frequency mechanical systems to their hot environments. Here we demonstrate sideband cooling of an approximately 10-MHz micromechanical oscillator to the quantum ground state. This achievement required a large electromechanical interaction, which was obtained by embedding a micromechanical membrane into a superconducting microwave resonant circuit. To verify the cooling of the membrane motion to a phonon occupation of 0.34 ± 0.05 phonons, we perform a near-Heisenberg-limited position measurement within (5.1 ± 0.4)h/2π, where h is Planck's constant. Furthermore, our device exhibits strong coupling, allowing coherent exchange of microwave photons and mechanical phonons. Simultaneously achieving strong coupling, ground state preparation and efficient measurement sets the stage for rapid advances in the control and detection of non-classical states of motion, possibly even testing quantum theory itself in the unexplored region of larger size and mass. Because mechanical oscillators can couple to light of any frequency, they could also serve as a unique intermediary for transferring quantum information between microwave and optical domains.},

   abstract = {Cooling of mechanical resonators is currently a popular topic in many fields of physics including ultra-high precision measurements, detection of gravitational waves and the study of the transition between classical and quantum behaviour of a mechanical system. Here we report the observation of self-cooling of a micromirror by radiation pressure inside a high-finesse optical cavity. In essence, changes in intensity in a detuned cavity, as caused by the thermal vibration of the mirror, provide the mechanism for entropy flow from the mirror's oscillatory motion to the low-entropy cavity field. The crucial coupling between radiation and mechanical motion was made possible by producing free-standing micromirrors of low mass (m approximately 400 ng), high reflectance (more than 99.6%) and high mechanical quality (Q approximately 10,000). We observe cooling of the mechanical oscillator by a factor of more than 30; that is, from room temperature to below 10 K. In addition to purely photothermal effects we identify radiation pressure as a relevant mechanism responsible for the cooling. In contrast with earlier experiments, our technique does not need any active feedback. We expect that improvements of our method will permit cooling ratios beyond 1,000 and will thus possibly enable cooling all the way down to the quantum mechanical ground state of the micromirror.},

In other work, a low frequency resonator was cooled from room temperature to 18 K by passive optical feedback. Additionally, active optical feedback of atomic force microscope cantilevers has been used to modify their response characteristics, and cooling to approximately 2 K has been measured. Here we demonstrate active optical feedback cooling to 135 +/- 15 mK of a micromechanical resonator integrated with a high-quality optical resonator. Additionally, we show that the scheme should be applicable at cryogenic base temperatures, allowing cooling to near the ground state that is required for quantum experiments--near 100 nK for a kHz oscillator.},

   abstract = {Macroscopic mechanical objects and electromagnetic degrees of freedom can couple to each other through radiation pressure. Optomechanical systems in which this coupling is sufficiently strong are predicted to show quantum effects and are a topic of considerable interest. Devices in this regime would offer new types of control over the quantum state of both light and matter, and would provide a new arena in which to explore the boundary between quantum and classical physics. Experiments so far have achieved sufficient optomechanical coupling to laser-cool mechanical devices, but have not yet reached the quantum regime. The outstanding technical challenge in this field is integrating sensitive micromechanical elements (which must be small, light and flexible) into high-finesse cavities (which are typically rigid and massive) without compromising the mechanical or optical properties of either. A second, and more fundamental, challenge is to read out the mechanical element's energy eigenstate. Displacement measurements (no matter how sensitive) cannot determine an oscillator's energy eigenstate, and measurements coupling to quantities other than displacement have been difficult to realize in practice. Here we present an optomechanical system that has the potential to resolve both of these challenges. We demonstrate a cavity which is detuned by the motion of a 50-nm-thick dielectric membrane placed between two macroscopic, rigid, high-finesse mirrors. This approach segregates optical and mechanical functionality to physically distinct structures and avoids compromising either. It also allows for direct measurement of the square of the membrane's displacement, and thus in principle the membrane's energy eigenstate. We estimate that it should be practical to use this scheme to observe quantum jumps of a mechanical system, an important goal in the field of quantum measurement.},

Here we measure the back-action of a superconducting single-electron transistor (SSET) on a radio-frequency nanomechanical resonator. The conductance of the SSET, which is capacitively coupled to the resonator, provides a sensitive probe of the latter's position; back-action effects manifest themselves as an effective thermal bath, the properties of which depend sensitively on SSET bias conditions. Surprisingly, when the SSET is biased near a transport resonance, we observe cooling of the nanomechanical mode from 550 mK to 300 mK--an effect that is analogous to laser cooling in atomic physics. Our measurements have implications for nanomechanical readout of quantum information devices and the limits of ultrasensitive force microscopy (such as single-nuclear-spin magnetic resonance force microscopy). Furthermore, we anticipate the use of these back-action effects to prepare ultracold and quantum states of mechanical structures, which would not be accessible with existing technology.},

Minimizing the width of the waveguides is desirable for photonic device applications, but the fabrication of low-loss optical waveguides with subwavelength diameters remains challenging because of strict requirements on surface roughness and diameter uniformity. Here we report the fabrication of subwavelength-diameter silica 'wires' for use as low-loss optical waveguides within the visible to near-infrared spectral range. We use a two-step drawing process to fabricate long free-standing silica wires with diameters down to 50 nm that show surface smoothness at the atomic level together with uniformity of diameter. Light can be launched into these wires by optical evanescent coupling. The wires allow single-mode operation, and have an optical loss of less than 0.1 dB mm(-1). We believe that these wires provide promising building blocks for future microphotonic devices with subwavelength-width structures.},

Their performance is in many cases limited by the deleterious effects of mechanical damping. In this study, we report a significant advancement towards understanding and controlling support-induced losses in generic mechanical resonators. We begin by introducing an efficient numerical solver, based on the 'phonon-tunnelling' approach, capable of predicting the design-limited damping of high-quality mechanical resonators. Further, through careful device engineering, we isolate support-induced losses and perform a rigorous experimental test of the strong geometric dependence of this loss mechanism. Our results are in excellent agreement with the theory, demonstrating the predictive power of our approach. In combination with recent progress on complementary dissipation mechanisms, our phonon-tunnelling solver represents a major step towards accurate prediction of the mechanical quality factor.},

   abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is well known as a powerful technique for visualizing subsurface structures with three-dimensional spatial resolution. Pushing the resolution below 1 micro m remains a major challenge, however, owing to the sensitivity limitations of conventional inductive detection techniques. Currently, the smallest volume elements in an image must contain at least 10(12) nuclear spins for MRI-based microscopy, or 10(7) electron spins for electron spin resonance microscopy. Magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) was proposed as a means to improve detection sensitivity to the single-spin level, and thus enable three-dimensional imaging of macromolecules (for example, proteins) with atomic resolution. MRFM has also been proposed as a qubit readout device for spin-based quantum computers. Here we report the detection of an individual electron spin by MRFM. A spatial resolution of 25 nm in one dimension was obtained for an unpaired spin in silicon dioxide. The measured signal is consistent with a model in which the spin is aligned parallel or anti-parallel to the effective field, with a rotating-frame relaxation time of 760 ms. The long relaxation time suggests that the state of an individual spin can be monitored for extended periods of time, even while subjected to a complex set of manipulations that are part of the MRFM measurement protocol.},

We demonstrate that the coupling results in a dispersive shift of the nanomechanical frequency that is the mechanical analogue of the 'single-atom index effect' experienced by electromagnetic resonators in cavity quantum electrodynamics. The large magnitude of the dispersive interaction allows us to perform NEMS-based spectroscopy of the superconducting qubit, and enables observation of Landau-Zener interference effects-a demonstration of nanomechanical read-out of quantum interference.},

   abstract = {A microscopic quantum system under continuous observation exhibits at random times sudden jumps between its states. The detection of this quantum feature requires a quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement repeated many times during the system's evolution. Whereas quantum jumps of trapped massive particles (electrons, ions or molecules) have been observed, this has proved more challenging for light quanta. Standard photodetectors absorb light and are thus unable to detect the same photon twice. It is therefore necessary to use a transparent counter that can 'see' photons without destroying them. Moreover, the light needs to be stored for durations much longer than the QND detection time. Here we report an experiment in which we fulfil these challenging conditions and observe quantum jumps in the photon number. Microwave photons are stored in a superconducting cavity for times up to half a second, and are repeatedly probed by a stream of non-absorbing atoms. An atom interferometer measures the atomic dipole phase shift induced by the non-resonant cavity field, so that the final atom state reveals directly the presence of a single photon in the cavity. Sequences of hundreds of atoms, highly correlated in the same state, are interrupted by sudden state switchings. These telegraphic signals record the birth, life and death of individual photons. Applying a similar QND procedure to mesoscopic fields with tens of photons should open new perspectives for the exploration of the quantum-to-classical boundary.},

   abstract = {The irreversible evolution of a microscopic system under measurement is a central feature of quantum theory. From an initial state generally exhibiting quantum uncertainty in the measured observable, the system is projected into a state in which this observable becomes precisely known. Its value is random, with a probability determined by the initial system's state. The evolution induced by measurement (known as 'state collapse') can be progressive, accumulating the effects of elementary state changes. Here we report the observation of such a step-by-step collapse by non-destructively measuring the photon number of a field stored in a cavity. Atoms behaving as microscopic clocks cross the cavity successively. By measuring the light-induced alterations of the clock rate, information is progressively extracted, until the initially uncertain photon number converges to an integer. The suppression of the photon number spread is demonstrated by correlations between repeated measurements. The procedure illustrates all the postulates of quantum measurement (state collapse, statistical results and repeatability) and should facilitate studies of non-classical fields trapped in cavities.},

   abstract = {The state of a microscopic system encodes its complete quantum description, from which the probabilities of all measurement outcomes are inferred. Being a statistical concept, the state cannot be obtained from a single system realization, but can instead be reconstructed from an ensemble of copies through measurements on different realizations. Reconstructing the state of a set of trapped particles shielded from their environment is an important step in the investigation of the quantum-classical boundary. Although trapped-atom state reconstructions have been achieved, it is challenging to perform similar experiments with trapped photons because cavities that can store light for very long times are required. Here we report the complete reconstruction and pictorial representation of a variety of radiation states trapped in a cavity in which several photons survive long enough to be repeatedly measured. Atoms crossing the cavity one by one are used to extract information about the field. We obtain images of coherent states, Fock states with a definite photon number and 'Schrödinger cat' states (superpositions of coherent states with different phases). These states are equivalently represented by their density matrices or Wigner functions. Quasi-classical coherent states have a Gaussian-shaped Wigner function, whereas the Wigner functions of Fock and Schrödinger cat states show oscillations and negativities revealing quantum interferences. Cavity damping induces decoherence that quickly washes out such oscillations. We observe this process and follow the evolution of decoherence by reconstructing snapshots of Schrödinger cat states at successive times. Our reconstruction procedure is a useful tool for further decoherence and quantum feedback studies of fields trapped in one or two cavities.},

   abstract = {Many effects in the interaction between atoms and a cavity that are usually de-scribed in quantum mechanical terms (cavity quantum electrodynamics, cavity QED) can be understood and quantitatively analyzed within a classical framework. We adopt such a classical picture of a radiating dipole oscillator to derive explicit ex- pressions for the coupling of single atoms and atomic ensembles to Gaussian modes in free space and in an optical resonator. The cooperativity parameter of cavity QED is shown to play a central role, and is given a geometrical interpretation. The classical analysis yields transparent, intuitive results that are useful for analyzing applications of cavity QED such as atom detection and counting, cavity cooling, cavity spin squeezing, cavity spin optomechanics, or phase transitions associated with the self-organization of the ensemble-light system.},

   abstract = {We present experimental techniques and recently demonstrated results related to the optimization and characterization of our recently demonstrated nanofiber-based atom trap. The atoms are confined in an optical lattice that is created using a two-color evanescent field surrounding the optical nanofiber. For this purpose, the polarization state of the trapping light fields has to be properly adjusted. We demonstrate that this can be accomplished by analyzing the light scattered by the nanofiber. Furthermore, we show that loading the nanofiber trap from a magneto-optical trap leads to sub-Doppler temperatures of the trapped atomic ensemble and yields a sub-Poissonian distribution of the number of trapped atoms per trapping site.},

   abstract = {Achieving coherent quantum control over massive mechanical resonators is a current research goal. Nano- and micromechanical devices can be coupled to a variety of systems, for example to single electrons by electrostatic or magnetic coupling, and to photons by radiation pressure or optical dipole forces. So far, all such experiments have operated in a regime of weak coupling, in which reversible energy exchange between the mechanical device and its coupled partner is suppressed by fast decoherence of the individual systems to their local environments. Controlled quantum experiments are in principle not possible in such a regime, but instead require strong coupling. So far, this has been demonstrated only between microscopic quantum systems, such as atoms and photons (in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics) or solid state qubits and photons. Strong coupling is an essential requirement for the preparation of mechanical quantum states, such as squeezed or entangled states, and also for using mechanical resonators in the context of quantum information processing, for example, as quantum transducers. Here we report the observation of optomechanical normal mode splitting, which provides unambiguous evidence for strong coupling of cavity photons to a mechanical resonator. This paves the way towards full quantum optical control of nano- and micromechanical devices.},

   abstract = {Thermal mechanical motion hinders the use of a mechanical system in applications such as quantum information processing. Whereas the thermal motion can be overcome by cooling a mechanical oscillator to its motional ground state, an alternative approach is to exploit the use of a mechanically dark mode that can protect the system from mechanical dissipation. We have realized such a dark mode by coupling two optical modes in a silica resonator to one of its mechanical breathing modes in the regime of weak optomechanical coupling. The dark mode, which is a superposition of the two optical modes and is decoupled from the mechanical oscillator, can still mediate an effective optomechanical coupling between the two optical modes. We show that the formation of the dark mode enables the transfer of optical fields between the two optical modes. Optomechanical dark mode opens the possibility of using mechanically mediated coupling in quantum applications without cooling the mechanical oscillator to its motional ground state.},

   abstract = {Both classical and quantum systems utilize the interaction of light and matter across a wide range of energies. These systems are often not naturally compatible with one another and require a means of converting photons of dissimilar wavelengths to combine and exploit their different strengths. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate coherent wavelength conversion of optical photons using photon-phonon translation in a cavity-optomechanical system. For an engineered silicon optomechanical crystal nanocavity supporting a 4-GHz localized phonon mode, optical signals in a 1.5 MHz bandwidth are coherently converted over a 11.2 THz frequency span between one cavity mode at wavelength 1,460 nm and a second cavity mode at 1,545 nm with a 93% internal (2% external) peak efficiency. The thermal- and quantum-limiting noise involved in the conversion process is also analysed, and in terms of an equivalent photon number signal level are found to correspond to an internal noise level of only 6 and 4 × 10(-3) quanta, respectively.},

   abstract = {We report on the first demonstration of a fully suspended 10 m Fabry-Perot cavity incorporating a waveguide grating as the coupling mirror. The cavity was kept on resonance by reading out the length fluctuations via the Pound-Drever-Hall method and employing feedback to the laser frequency. From the achieved finesse of 790 the grating reflectivity was determined to exceed 99.2% at the laser wavelength of 1064 nm, which is in good agreement with rigorous simulations. Our waveguide grating design was based on tantala and fused silica and included a ≈ 20 nm thin etch stop layer made of Al2O3 that allowed us to define the grating depth accurately and preserve the waveguide thickness during the fabrication process. Demonstrating stable operation of a waveguide grating featuring high reflectivity in a suspended low-noise cavity, our work paves the way for the potential application of waveguide gratings as mirrors in high-precision interferometry, for instance in future gravitational wave observatories.},

@article{Unterreithmeier2009,
   abstract = {Any polarizable body placed in an inhomogeneous electric field experiences a dielectric force. This phenomenon is well known from the macroscopic world: a water jet is deflected when approached by a charged object. This fundamental mechanism is exploited in a variety of contexts-for example, trapping microscopic particles in an optical tweezer, where the trapping force is controlled via the intensity of a laser beam, or dielectrophoresis, where electric fields are used to manipulate particles in liquids. Here we extend the underlying concept to the rapidly evolving field of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). A broad range of possible applications are anticipated for these systems, but drive and detection schemes for nanomechanical motion still need to be optimized. Our approach is based on the application of dielectric gradient forces for the controlled and local transduction of NEMS. Using a set of on-chip electrodes to create an electric field gradient, we polarize a dielectric resonator and subject it to an attractive force that can be modulated at high frequencies. This universal actuation scheme is efficient, broadband and scalable. It also separates the driving scheme from the driven mechanical element, allowing for arbitrary polarizable materials and thus potentially ultralow dissipation NEMS. In addition, it enables simple voltage tuning of the mechanical resonance over a wide frequency range, because the dielectric force depends strongly on the resonator-electrode separation. We use the modulation of the resonance frequency to demonstrate parametric actuation. Moreover, we reverse the actuation principle to realize dielectric detection, thus allowing universal transduction of NEMS. We expect this combination to be useful both in the study of fundamental principles and in applications such as signal processing and sensing.},

A simple model based on a random scattering matrix clearly visualizes the mixing and avoided crossings between multiple transverse modes. These effects are visible only in the frequency-domain spectra; cavity ringdown experiments are unaffected by changes in the spatial coherence, as they probe just the intracavity photon lifetime.},

   abstract = {Nanomechanical oscillators are at the heart of ultrasensitive detectors of force, mass and motion. As these detectors progress to even better sensitivity, they will encounter measurement limits imposed by the laws of quantum mechanics. If the imprecision of a measurement of the displacement of an oscillator is pushed below a scale set by the standard quantum limit, the measurement must perturb the motion of the oscillator by an amount larger than that scale. Here we show a displacement measurement with an imprecision below the standard quantum limit scale. We achieve this imprecision by measuring the motion of a nanomechanical oscillator with a nearly shot-noise limited microwave interferometer. As the interferometer is naturally operated at cryogenic temperatures, the thermal motion of the oscillator is minimized, yielding an excellent force detector with a sensitivity of 0.51 aN Hz(-1/2). This measurement is a critical step towards observing quantum behaviour in a mechanical object.},

   abstract = {Observing a physical quantity without disturbing it is a key capability for the control of individual quantum systems. Such back-action-evading or quantum-non-demolition measurements were first introduced in the 1970s in the context of gravitational wave detection to measure weak forces on test masses by high precision monitoring of their motion. Now, such techniques have become an indispensable tool in quantum science for preparing, manipulating, and detecting quantum states of light, atoms, and other quantum systems. Here we experimentally perform rapid optical quantum-noise-limited measurements of the position of a mechanical oscillator by using pulses of light with a duration much shorter than a period of mechanical motion. Using this back-action evading interaction we performed both state preparation and full state tomography of the mechanical motional state. We have reconstructed mechanical states with a position uncertainty reduced to 19 pm, limited by the quantum fluctuations of the optical pulse, and we have performed `cooling-by-measurement' to reduce the mechanical mode temperature from an initial 1100 K to 16 K. Future improvements to this technique may allow for quantum squeezing of mechanical motion, even from room temperature, and reconstruction of non-classical states exhibiting negative regions in their phase-space quasi-probability distribution.},

   abstract = {In this paper we study and design quasi-2D optomechanical crystals, waveguides, and resonant cavities formed from patterned slabs. Two-dimensional periodicity allows for in-plane pseudo-bandgaps in frequency where resonant optical and mechanical excitations localized to the slab are forbidden. By tailoring the unit cell geometry, we show that it is possible to have a slab crystal with simultaneous optical and mechanical pseudo-bandgaps, and for which optical waveguiding is not compromised. We then use these crystals to design optomechanical cavities in which strongly interacting, co-localized photonic-phononic resonances occur. A resonant cavity structure formed by perturbing a ;;linear defect' waveguide of optical and acoustic waves in a silicon optomechanical crystal slab is shown to support an optical resonance at wavelength lambda(0) approximately 1.5 mum and a mechanical resonance of frequency omega(m)/2pi approximately 9.5 GHz. These resonances, due to the simultaneous pseudo-bandgap of the waveguide structure, are simulated to have optical and mechanical radiation-limited Q-factors greater than 10(7). The optomechanical coupling of the optical and acousticresonances in this cavity due to radiation pressure is also studied, with a quantum conversion rate, corresponding to the scattering rate of a single cavity photon via a single cavity phonon, calculated to be g/2pi = 292 kHz.},

   abstract = {The paper addresses the leaky stop bands associated with resonant photonic crystal slabs and periodic waveguides. We apply a semianalytical model pertinent to the second band to compute the dispersion curves describing the leaky stop band and verify its correctness by rigorous band computations. This approximate model provides clear insights into the physical properties of the leaky stop band in terms of explicit analytical expressions found. In particular, it enables comparison of the structure of the bands computed in complex propagation constant, implying spatially decaying leaky modes, with the bands computed in complex frequency, implying temporally decaying modes. It is shown that coexisting Braggcoupling and energy-leakage mechanisms perturb the bands in complex propagation constant whereas these mechanisms are decoupled in complex frequency. As a result, the bands in complex frequency are well defined exhibiting a clear gap. These conclusions are verified by numerical diffraction computations for both weak and strong grating modulations where the resonance peaks induced by external illumination are shown to closely track the band profile computed in complex frequency. Thus, in general, phase matching to a resonant leaky mode occurs via real propagation constant that is found by dispersion computations employing complex frequency.},

   abstract = {Quantum computers, which harness the superposition and entanglement of physical states, could outperform their classical counterparts in solving problems with technological impact-such as factoring large numbers and searching databases. A quantum processor executes algorithms by applying a programmable sequence of gates to an initialized register of qubits, which coherently evolves into a final state containing the result of the computation. Building a quantum processor is challenging because of the need to meet simultaneously requirements that are in conflict: state preparation, long coherence times, universal gate operations and qubit readout. Processors based on a few qubits have been demonstrated using nuclear magnetic resonance, cold ion trap and optical systems, but a solid-state realization has remained an outstanding challenge. Here we demonstrate a two-qubit superconducting processor and the implementation of the Grover search and Deutsch-Jozsa quantum algorithms. We use a two-qubit interaction, tunable in strength by two orders of magnitude on nanosecond timescales, which is mediated by a cavity bus in a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. This interaction allows the generation of highly entangled states with concurrence up to 94 per cent. Although this processor constitutes an important step in quantum computing with integrated circuits, continuing efforts to increase qubit coherence times, gate performance and register size will be required to fulfil the promise of a scalable technology.},

   abstract = {Quantum computers could be used to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers, but are challenging to build because of their increased susceptibility to errors. However, it is possible to detect and correct errors without destroying coherence, by using quantum error correcting codes. The simplest of these are three-quantum-bit (three-qubit) codes, which map a one-qubit state to an entangled three-qubit state; they can correct any single phase-flip or bit-flip error on one of the three qubits, depending on the code used. Here we demonstrate such phase- and bit-flip error correcting codes in a superconducting circuit. We encode a quantum state, induce errors on the qubits and decode the error syndrome--a quantum state indicating which error has occurred--by reversing the encoding process. This syndrome is then used as the input to a three-qubit gate that corrects the primary qubit if it was flipped. As the code can recover from a single error on any qubit, the fidelity of this process should decrease only quadratically with error probability. We implement the correcting three-qubit gate (known as a conditional-conditional NOT, or Toffoli, gate) in 63 nanoseconds, using an interaction with the third excited state of a single qubit. We find 85 ± 1 per cent fidelity to the expected classical action of this gate, and 78 ± 1 per cent fidelity to the ideal quantum process matrix. Using this gate, we perform a single pass of both quantum bit- and phase-flip error correction and demonstrate the predicted first-order insensitivity to errors. Concatenation of these two codes in a nine-qubit device would correct arbitrary single-qubit errors. In combination with recent advances in superconducting qubit coherence times, this could lead to scalable quantum technology.},

   abstract = {An elementary quantum network operation involves storing a qubit state in an atomic quantum memory node, and then retrieving and transporting the information through a single photon excitation to a remote quantum memory node for further storage or analysis. Implementations of quantum network operations are thus conditioned on the ability to realize matter-to-light and/or light-to-matter quantum state mappings. Here we report the generation, transmission, storage and retrieval of single quanta using two remote atomic ensembles. A single photon is generated from a cold atomic ensemble at one site , and is directed to another site through 100 metres of optical fibre. The photon is then converted into a single collective atomic excitation using a dark-state polariton approach. After a programmable storage time, the atomic excitation is converted back into a single photon. This is demonstrated experimentally, for a storage time of 0.5 microseconds, by measurement of an anti-correlation parameter. Storage times exceeding ten microseconds are observed by intensity cross-correlation measurements. This storage period is two orders of magnitude longer than the time required to achieve conversion between photonic and atomic quanta. The controlled transfer of single quanta between remote quantum memories constitutes an important step towards distributed quantum networks.},

This peculiar property is used in optical, atomic, and electrical systems in an effort to exceed classical bounds when processing information. Here, we extend the domain of this quantum resource by entangling the motion of a macroscopic mechanical oscillator with a propagating electrical signal and by storing one-half of the entangled state in the mechanical oscillator. This result demonstrates an essential requirement for using compact and low-loss micromechanical oscillators in a quantum processor, it can be extended to sense forces beyond the standard quantum limit, and it may enable tests of quantum theory.},

   abstract = {The dynamic back-action caused by electromagnetic forces (radiation pressure) in optical and microwave cavities is of growing interest. Back-action cooling, for example, is being pursued as a means of achieving the quantum ground state of macroscopic mechanical oscillators. Work in the optical domain has revolved around millimetre- or micrometre-scale structures using the radiation pressure force. By comparison, in microwave devices, low-loss superconducting structures have been used for gradient-force-mediated coupling to a nanomechanical oscillator of picogram mass. Here we describe measurements of an optical system consisting of a pair of specially patterned nanoscale beams in which optical and mechanical energies are simultaneously localized to a cubic-micron-scale volume, and for which large per-photon optical gradient forces are realized. The resulting scale of the per-photon force and the mass of the structure enable the exploration of cavity optomechanical regimes in which, for example, the mechanical rigidity of the structure is dominantly provided by the internal light field itself. In addition to precision measurement and sensitive force detection, nano-optomechanics may find application in reconfigurable and tunable photonic systems, light-based radio-frequency communication and the generation of giant optical nonlinearities for wavelength conversion and optical buffering.},

   abstract = {Low-loss transmission and sensitive recovery of weak radio-frequency and microwave signals is a ubiquitous challenge, crucial in radio astronomy, medical imaging, navigation, and classical and quantum communication. Efficient up-conversion of radio-frequency signals to an optical carrier would enable their transmission through optical fibres instead of through copper wires, drastically reducing losses, and would give access to the set of established quantum optical techniques that are routinely used in quantum-limited signal detection. Research in cavity optomechanics has shown that nanomechanical oscillators can couple strongly to either microwave or optical fields. Here we demonstrate a room-temperature optoelectromechanical transducer with both these functionalities, following a recent proposal using a high-quality nanomembrane. A voltage bias of less than 10 V is sufficient to induce strong coupling between the voltage fluctuations in a radio-frequency resonance circuit and the membrane's displacement, which is simultaneously coupled to light reflected off its surface. The radio-frequency signals are detected as an optical phase shift with quantum-limited sensitivity. The corresponding half-wave voltage is in the microvolt range, orders of magnitude less than that of standard optical modulators. The noise of the transducer--beyond the measured 800 pV Hz-1/2 Johnson noise of the resonant circuit--consists of the quantum noise of light and thermal fluctuations of the membrane, dominating the noise floor in potential applications in radio astronomy and nuclear magnetic imaging. Each of these contributions is inferred to be 60 pV Hz-1/2 when balanced by choosing an electromechanical cooperativity of ~150 with an optical power of 1 mW. The noise temperature of the membrane is divided by the cooperativity. For the highest observed cooperativity of 6,800, this leads to a projected noise temperature of 40 mK and a sensitivity limit of 5 pV Hz-1/2. Our approach to all-optical, ultralow-noise detection of classical electronic signals sets the stage for coherent up-conversion of low-frequency quantum signals to the optical domain.},

It allows a quantum system to be 'in two places at the same time', because the quantum state of a physical system can simultaneously include measurably different physical states. The preparation and use of such superposed states forms the basis of quantum computation and simulation. The creation of complex superpositions in harmonic systems (such as the motional state of trapped ions, microwave resonators or optical cavities) has presented a significant challenge because it cannot be achieved with classical control signals. Here we demonstrate the preparation and measurement of arbitrary quantum states in an electromagnetic resonator, superposing states with different numbers of photons in a completely controlled and deterministic manner. We synthesize the states using a superconducting phase qubit to phase-coherently pump photons into the resonator, making use of an algorithm that generalizes a previously demonstrated method of generating photon number (Fock) states in a resonator. We completely characterize the resonator quantum state using Wigner tomography, which is equivalent to measuring the resonator's full density matrix.},

   abstract = {Einstein's general theory of relativity predicts that accelerating mass distributions produce gravitational radiation, analogous to electromagnetic radiation from accelerating charges. These gravitational waves (GWs) have not been directly detected to date, but are expected to open a new window to the Universe once the detectors, kilometre-scale laser interferometers measuring the distance between quasi-free-falling mirrors, have achieved adequate sensitivity. Recent advances in quantum metrology may now contribute to provide the required sensitivity boost. The so-called squeezed light is able to quantum entangle the high-power laser fields in the interferometer arms, and could have a key role in the realization of GW astronomy.},

   abstract = {Multiparticle entanglement enables quantum simulations, quantum computing and quantum-enhanced metrology. Yet, there are few methods to produce and measure such entanglement while maintaining single-qubit resolution as the number of qubits is scaled up. Using atom chips and fiber-optical cavities, we have developed a method based on non-destructive collective measurement and conditional evolution to create symmetric entangled states and perform their tomography. We demonstrate creation and analysis of entangled states with mean atom numbers up to 41 and experimentally prove multiparticle entanglement. Our method is independent of atom number and should allow generalization to other entangled states and other physical implementations including circuit quantum electrodynamics.},

@article{Teufel2011a,
   abstract = {Demonstrating and exploiting the quantum nature of macroscopic mechanical objects would help us to investigate directly the limitations of quantum-based measurements and quantum information protocols, as well as to test long-standing questions about macroscopic quantum coherence. Central to this effort is the necessity of long-lived mechanical states. Previous efforts have witnessed quantum behaviour, but for a low-quality-factor mechanical system. The field of cavity optomechanics and electromechanics, in which a high-quality-factor mechanical oscillator is parametrically coupled to an electromagnetic cavity resonance, provides a practical architecture for cooling, manipulation and detection of motion at the quantum level. One requirement is strong coupling, in which the interaction between the two systems is faster than the dissipation of energy from either system. Here, by incorporating a free-standing, flexible aluminium membrane into a lumped-element superconducting resonant cavity, we have increased the single-photon coupling strength between these two systems by more than two orders of magnitude, compared to previously obtained coupling strengths. A parametric drive tone at the difference frequency between the mechanical oscillator and the cavity resonance dramatically increases the overall coupling strength, allowing us to completely enter the quantum-enabled, strong-coupling regime. This is evidenced by a maximum normal-mode splitting of nearly six bare cavity linewidths. Spectroscopic measurements of these 'dressed states' are in excellent quantitative agreement with recent theoretical predictions. The basic circuit architecture presented here provides a feasible path to ground-state cooling and subsequent coherent control and measurement of long-lived quantum states of mechanical motion.},

   abstract = {Cold, macroscopic mechanical systems are expected to behave contrary to our usual classical understanding of reality; the most striking and counterintuitive predictions involve the existence of states in which the mechanical system is located in two places simultaneously. Various schemes have been proposed to generate and detect such states, and all require starting from mechanical states that are close to the lowest energy eigenstate, the mechanical ground state. Here we report the cooling of the motion of a radio-frequency nanomechanical resonator by parametric coupling to a driven, microwave-frequency superconducting resonator. Starting from a thermal occupation of 480 quanta, we have observed occupation factors as low as 3.8 +/- 1.3 and expect the mechanical resonator to be found with probability 0.21 in the quantum ground state of motion. Further cooling is limited by random excitation of the microwave resonator and heating of the dissipative mechanical bath. This level of cooling is expected to make possible a series of fundamental quantum mechanical observations including direct measurement of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and quantum entanglement with qubits.},

The ratio of the amplitude of Stokes to anti-Stokes scattered light is used to measure temperatures of optically-cooled mechanical modes down to the level of a few vibrational quanta.

Electronic and nuclear spins are natural candidates for the storage medium as their coherence time can be well above one second. Benefiting from these long coherence times requires to apply the refocusing techniques used in magnetic resonance, a major challenge in the context of hybrid quantum circuits. Here we report the first implementation of such a scheme, using ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond coupled to a superconducting resonator, in a setup compatible with superconducting qubit technology. We implement the active reset of the NV spins into their ground state by optical pumping and their refocusing by Hahn echo sequences. This enables the storage of multiple microwave pulses at the picoWatt level and their retrieval after up to $35 \mu$s, a three orders of magnitude improvement compared to previous experiments.},

As a quantity in electronic circuits, negative mutual inductance is usually so much smaller in magnitude than overall inductance that it can be neglected with little effect. In the microelectronic world, however, its neglect can result in inductance values as much as 30 percent too high. This paper derives inductance equations for planar thin- or thick-film coils, comparing equations that include negative mutual inductance with those that do not. It describes a computer program developed for calculating inductances for both square and rectangular geometries, the variables considered being track width, space between tracks, and number of turns. Graphic results are presented for up to 16 turns over an inductance range of 3 nanohenries to 10 microhenries. Although details of fabrication are not included, the effects of film thickness and frequency on the mutual-inductance parameter are discussed.},

   abstract = {Printed spiral coils (PSCs) are viable candidates for near-field wireless power transmission to the next generation of high-performance neuroprosthetic devices with extreme size constraints, which will target intraocular and intracranial spaces. Optimizing the PSC geometries to maximize the power transfer efficiency of the wireless link is imperative to reduce the size of the external energy source, heating of the tissue, and interference with other devices. Implantable devices need to be hermetically sealed in biocompatible materials and placed in a conductive environment with high permittivity (tissue), which can affect the PSC characteristics. We have constructed a detailed model that includes the effects of the surrounding environment on the PSC parasitic components and eventually on the power transfer efficiency. We have combined this model with an iterative design method that starts with a set of realistic design constraints and ends with the optimal PSC geometries. We applied our design methodology to optimize the wireless link of a 1-cm2 implantable device example, operating at 13.56 MHz. Measurement results showed that optimized PSC pairs, coated with 0.3 mm of silicone, achieved 72.2%, 51.8%, and 30.8% efficiencies at a face-to-face relative distance of 10 mm in air, saline, and muscle, respectively. The PSC, which was optimized for air, could only bear 40.8% and 21.8% efficiencies in saline and muscle, respectively, showing that by including the PSC tissue environment in the design process the result can be more than a 9% improvement in the power transfer efficiency.},

   abstract = {Photonic Crystals is the first book to address one of the newest and most exciting developments in physics-the discovery of photonic band-gap materials and their use in controlling the propagation of light. Recent discoveries show that many of the properties of an electron in a semiconductor crystal can apply to a particle of light in a photonic crystal. This has vast implications for physicists, materials scientists, and electrical engineers and suggests such possible developments as an entirely optical computer. Combining cutting-edge research with the basic theoretical concepts behind photonic crystals, the authors present to undergraduates and researchers a concise, readable, and comprehensive text on these novel materials and their applications.The first chapters develop the theoretical tools of photonic crystals in a broad, intuitive fashion, starting from nothing more than Maxwell's equations and Fourier analysis, and include analogies to traditional solid-state physics and quantum theory. There follows an investigation of the unique phenomena that take place within photonic crystals, at defect sites, and at surfaces and interfaces. The authors offer a new treatment of the traditional multilayer film (a one-dimensional photonic crystal), which allows for the extension to higher dimensions and more complex geometries. After exploring the capabilities of photonic crystals to guide and localize light, the authors demonstrate how these notions can be put to work.},

   abstract = {The information carrier of today's communications, a weak pulse of light, is an intrinsically quantum object. As a consequence, complete information about the pulse cannot be perfectly recorded in a classical memory, even in principle. In the field of quantum information, this has led to the long-standing challenge of how to achieve a high-fidelity transfer of an independently prepared quantum state of light onto an atomic quantum state. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a protocol for such a quantum memory based on atomic ensembles. Recording of an externally provided quantum state of light onto the atomic quantum memory is achieved with 70 per cent fidelity, significantly higher than the limit for classical recording. Quantum storage of light is achieved in three steps: first, interaction of the input pulse and an entangling field with spin-polarized caesium atoms; second, subsequent measurement of the transmitted light; and third, feedback onto the atoms using a radio-frequency magnetic pulse conditioned on the measurement result. The density of recorded states is 33 per cent higher than the best classical recording of light onto atoms, with a quantum memory lifetime of up to 4 milliseconds.},

   abstract = {Over the past decade, strong interactions of light and matter at the single-photon level have enabled a wide set of scientific advances in quantum optics and quantum information science. This work has been performed principally within the setting of cavity quantum electrodynamics with diverse physical systems, including single atoms in Fabry-Perot resonators, quantum dots coupled to micropillars and photonic bandgap cavities and Cooper pairs interacting with superconducting resonators. Experiments with single, localized atoms have been at the forefront of these advances with the use of optical resonators in high-finesse Fabry-Perot configurations. As a result of the extreme technical challenges involved in further improving the multilayer dielectric mirror coatings of these resonators and in scaling to large numbers of devices, there has been increased interest in the development of alternative microcavity systems. Here we show strong coupling between individual caesium atoms and the fields of a high-quality toroidal microresonator. From observations of transit events for single atoms falling through the resonator's evanescent field, we determine the coherent coupling rate for interactions near the surface of the resonator. We develop a theoretical model to quantify our observations, demonstrating that strong coupling is achieved, with the rate of coherent coupling exceeding the dissipative rates of the atom and the cavity. Our work opens the way for investigations of optical processes with single atoms and photons in lithographically fabricated microresonators. Applications include the implementation of quantum networks, scalable quantum logic with photons, and quantum information processing on atom chips.},

These parameters, and therefore the properties of the interferometer, are invariant under an appropriate scaling of SR-mirror reflectivity, SR detuning, arm-cavity storage time and input power at beamsplitter.

Driving force in this model is the change in density in the gap volume due to the amplitude of the oscillating microstructure, which is counteracted by the random walk diffusion in the gap that tries to restore the density to its equilibrium value. This results in a complex-valued force that contributes to both the damping as well as the spring constant, depending on the value of ω τ with ω the resonance frequency and τ the random walk diffusion time. The diffusion time is calculated analytically using the model for random walk Brownian motion and numerically by a Monte Carlo simulation of the ballistic trajectories of the molecules following Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics and full thermal accommodation in gas-surface collisions. The model is verified by comparison to accurate data on the pressure dependency of the damping of three MEMS resonators, showing agreement within 10%. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We propose a new effective dielectric tensor for anisotropic structures, and demonstrate that O Delta x;2 convergence can be achieved even in systems with sharp material discontinuities. We show how it is possible to solve for interior eigenvalues, such as localized defect modes, without computing the many underlying eigenstates. Preconditioned conjugate-gradient Rayleigh-quotient minimization is compared with the Davidson method for eigensolution, and a number of iteration variants and preconditioners are characterized.

In this work, we calculate fluid damping and its effect on damped resonance frequency omega(d), and quality factor Q, for oscillating long beams at micrometer and submicrometer scales. For beams of nanometer scale, which are smaller than the mean free path of air molecules at standard conditions, the continuum limit breaks down and the commonly used Stokes drag calculation must be replaced by the appropriate calculation for rarefied gas flow. At scales where the continuum limit holds, this quasisteady Stokes solution is often still inapplicable due to the high resonant frequency associated with small beams, typically 10(2) MHz. The unsteady drag can be over two orders of magnitude higher than that predicted by the quasisteady Stokes solution and the added mass is non-negligible. Here we calculate Q factors as a function of gas pressure over the range from 10(-5) torr to 10(5) torr, corresponding to free molecular to continuum limit. The comparison of the Q factors for two typical beams at various pressures suggests an advantage of using submicrometer scale over micrometer scale beams for applications near ambient pressure.},

The cantilever beams are fabricated from monocrystalline silicon by means of micromachining methods. Their size is a few millimeters in length, a few 100 μm in width, and a few 10 μm in thickness. Damping and resonance frequency are studied as a function of the ambient pressure p (1–105 Pa) and the geometry of the beam. The purpose of this research was to obtain design rules for sensors employing vibrating beams. The analysis of the experimental results in terms of a semiqualitative model reveals that one can distinguish three mechanisms for the pressure dependence of the damping: viscous, molecular, and intrinsic. For viscous damping a turbulent boundary layer dominates the damping at high pressures (≊105 Pa), while at smaller pressure laminar flow dominates. In the latter region, this leads to a plateau for the quality factor Q and in the former to Q α √p. The pressure pc at which the transition from laminar flow dominated damping to turbulent flow dominated damping occurs depends on the geometry of the beams. pc is independent on the length and decreases with both, the width and the thickness of the beams.},

   abstract = {Silicon nitride (SiN) micro- and nanomechanical resonators have attracted a lot of attention in various research fields due to their exceptionally high quality factors (Qs). Despite their popularity, the origin of the limiting loss mechanisms in these structures has remained controversial. In this paper we propose an analytical model combining acoustic radiation loss with intrinsic loss. The model accurately predicts the resulting mode-dependent Qs of a low-stress silicon-rich and a high- stress stoichiometric SiN membrane. The large acoustic mismatch of the low-stress membrane to the substrate seems to minimize radiation loss and Qs of higher modes (n and m >= 3) are limited by intrinsic losses. The study of these intrinsic losses in low-stress membranes with varying lengths L and thicknesses h reveals an inverse linear dependence of the intrinsic loss with h for thin resonators independent of L. This finding was confirmed by comparing the intrinsic dissipation of arbitrary (membranes, strings, and cantilevers) SiN resonators extracted from literature, suggesting surface loss as ubiquitous damping mechanism in thin SiN resonators with Qsurf=b h and b=6e10 \pm 4e10 m^\{-1\}. Based on the intrinsic loss the maximal achievable Qs and Qxf products for SiN membranes and strings are outlined.},

   abstract = {Surface effects in ultrathin single-crystal silicon cantilevers of 170 nm thickness, which are optically actuated mainly by the light pressure effect, are investigated under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) condition. Annealing the cantilevers at 1000 °C for 30 s in UHV results in an over 1 order of magnitude increase of the quality factor (Q factor), up to about 2.5×105 for cantilevers of 30–90 μm in length. The improvement of Q factor was found to be associated with the deoxidization of the surface, as determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These results suggest that the surface effects in the ultrathin cantilevers dominate their mechanical behavior. With the promising mechanical behavior, the cantilever can be easily actuated by a laser beam (beam size: about 300×100 μm2) with power down to less than 40 μW at a wavelength of 680 nm, corresponding to 480 nW, i.e., 1.64×1012 photons/s, irradiated on the cantilever surface (60×6 μm2). This provides a rather simple way to operate the ultrathin cantilevers dynamically in UHV. Atomic scale force resolution (4.8×10−17 N) at 300 K is also expected with these cantilevers. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.},

An integrated piezoelectric transducer is used for direct and parametric excitation. First, the parametric amplification and oscillation of a single mode are analyzed by the power and phase dependence below and above the threshold for parametric oscillation. Then, the motion of a parametrically driven mode is detected by the induced change in resonance frequency in another mode of the same resonator. The resonance frequency shift is the result of the nonlinear coupling between the modes by the displacement-induced tension in the beam. These nonlinear modal interactions result in the quadratic relation between the resonance frequency of one mode and the amplitude of another mode. The amplitude of a parametrically oscillating mode depends on the square root of the pump frequency. Combining these dependencies yields a linear relation between the resonance frequency of the directly driven mode and the frequency of the parametrically oscillating mode.},

   abstract = {Recent progress in nanotechnology has allowed the fabrication of new hybrid systems in which a single two-level system is coupled to a mechanical nanoresonator. In such systems the quantum nature of a macroscopic degree of freedom can be revealed and manipulated. This opens up appealing perspectives for quantum information technologies, and for the exploration of the quantum-classical boundary. Here we present the experimental realization of a monolithic solid-state hybrid system governed by material strain: a quantum dot is embedded within a nanowire that features discrete mechanical resonances corresponding to flexural vibration modes. Mechanical vibrations result in a time-varying strain field that modulates the quantum dot transition energy. This approach simultaneously offers a large light-extraction efficiency and a large exciton-phonon coupling strength g0. By means of optical and mechanical spectroscopy, we find that g0/2 π is nearly as large as the mechanical frequency, a criterion that defines the ultrastrong coupling regime.},

For thin MoS2, the excited phonon frequency exhibits a standing wave nature and shows linear dependence on the sample thickness. The frequency varies from 40 GHz to 0.2 THz (10 layers), which promises possible application in THz frequency mechanical resonators. This linear thickness dependence gradually disappears in thicker samples above about 150 layers, and the oscillation period shows linear dependence on the probe wavelength. From both the oscillation period of the coherent phonon and the delay time of acoustic echo, we can deduce a consistent sound velocity of 7.11*10(3) m/s in MoS2. The generation mechanisms of the coherent acoustic phonon are also discussed through pump power dependent measurement.},

   abstract = {Hybrid quantum systems with inherently distinct degrees of freedom have a key role in many physical phenomena. Well-known examples include cavity quantum electrodynamics, trapped ions, and electrons and phonons in the solid state. In those systems, strong coupling makes the constituents lose their individual character and form dressed states, which represent a collective form of dynamics. As well as having fundamental importance, hybrid systems also have practical applications, notably in the emerging field of quantum information control. A promising approach is to combine long-lived atomic states with the accessible electrical degrees of freedom in superconducting cavities and quantum bits (qubits). Here we integrate circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics with phonons. Apart from coupling to a microwave cavity, our superconducting transmon qubit, consisting of tunnel junctions and a capacitor, interacts with a phonon mode in a micromechanical resonator, and thus acts like an atom coupled to two different cavities. We measure the phonon Stark shift, as well as the splitting of the qubit spectral line into motional sidebands, which feature transitions between the dressed electromechanical states. In the time domain, we observe coherent conversion of qubit excitation to phonons as sideband Rabi oscillations. This is a model system with potential for a quantum interface, which may allow for storage of quantum information in long-lived phonon states, coupling to optical photons or for investigations of strongly coupled quantum systems near the classical limit.},

   abstract = {Current approaches to Mass Spectrometry (MS) necessarily rely on the ionization of the analytes of interest and subsequent spectrum interpretation is based on the mass-to-charge ratios of the ions. The resulting charge state distribution can be very complex for high-mass species which may hinder correct interpretation. A new form of MS analysis based on Nano-Electro-Mechanical Systems (NEMS) was recently demonstrated with high-mass ions. Thanks to a dedicated setup comprising both conventional time-of-flight MS (TOF-MS) and NEMS-MS in-situ, we show here for the first time that NEMS-MS analysis is insensitive to charge state: it provides one single peak regardless of the species charge state, highlighting effective clarification over existing MS analysis. All charged particles were thereafter removed from the beam electrostatically, and unlike TOF-MS, NEMS-MS retained its ability to perform mass measurements. This constitutes the first unequivocal measurement of mass spectra of neutral particles. This ability enables further fundamental studies of analytes out of reach today because of their highly challenging ionization and opens the way towards cutting edge system architectures with unique analytical capability.},

It is based on a semiconductor superlattice gain medium, inside a multimode cavity between two acoustic Bragg reflectors. We measure the acoustic output of the device as a function of time after applying electrical pumping. The emission builds in intensity reaching a steady state on a timescale of order 0.1 μs. We show that the results are consistent with a model of the dynamics of a saser cavity exactly analogous to the models used for describing laser dynamics. We also obtain estimates for the gain coefficient, steady-state acoustic power output and efficiency of the device.},

To date, cloaking has been demonstrated experimentally in many fields of research, including electrodynamics at microwave frequencies, optics, static electric conduction, acoustics, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics and quasi two-dimensional solid mechanics. However, cloaking in the seemingly simple case of three-dimensional solid mechanics is more demanding. Here, inspired by invisible core-shell nanoparticles in optics, we design an approximate elasto-mechanical core-shell 'unfeelability' cloak based on pentamode metamaterials. The resulting three-dimensional polymer microstructures with macroscopic overall volume are fabricated by rapid dip-in direct laser writing optical lithography. We quasi-statically deform cloak and control samples in the linear regime and map the displacement fields by autocorrelation-based analysis of recorded movies. The measured and the calculated displacement fields show very good cloaking performance. This means that one can elastically hide objects along these lines.},

   abstract = {Methods are developed for discussing the photon statistics of arbitrary radiation fields in fully quantum- mechanical terms. In order to keep the classical limit of quantum electrodynamics plainly in view, extensive use is made of the coherent states of the field. These states, which reduce the field correlation functions to factorized forms, are shown to offer a convenient basis for the description of fields of all types. Although they are not orthogonal to one another, the coherent states form a complete set. It is shown that any quan- tum state of the field may be expanded in terms of them in a unique way. Expansions are also developed for arbitrary operators in terms of products of the coherent state vectors. These expansions are discussed as a general method of representing the density operator for the field. A particular form is exhibited for the density operator which makes it possible to carry out many quantum-mechanical calculations by methods resembling those of classical theory. This representation permits clear insights into the essential distinction between the quantum and classical descriptions of the field. It leads, in addition, to a simple formulation of a superposition law for photon fields. Detailed discussions are given of the incoherent fields which are generated by superposing the outputs of many stationary sources. These fields are all shown to have inti- mately related properties, some of which have been known for the particular case of blackbody radiation.},

As is well known, but often overlooked, two longitudinal field modes contribute to each spectral component of the photocurrent (sideband modes). We show that spectral homodyne detection is intrinsically incapable of providing all the information needed for the full reconstruction of the two-mode spectral quantum state. Such a limitation is overcome by the technique of resonator detection. A detailed theoretical description and comparison of both methods is presented, as well as an experiment to measure the six-mode quantum state of pump-signal-idler beams of an optical parametric oscillator above the oscillation threshold.},

In this article we review and clarify this phenomenon by analyzing systematically the relations between the correlations of modes filtered from stationary continuous fields and the cross power spectrum between the operators of the corresponding spectral components. Moreover, we study the specific spectral components that are filtered in homodyne or heterodyne detections and their entanglement properties. In particular, we establish the equivalence between two-mode squeezing variance and logarithmic negativity for the spectral components of continuous stationary fields, thereby demonstrating that the measurement of the homodyne or heterodyne spectrum is, in fact, a direct measurement of the logarithmic negativity between specific spectral modes. As an illustrative example, we apply these concepts to the analysis of entanglement in ponderomotive squeezing.},

Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false.

The experimental challenge for its implementation is the stringent requirement on low thermal noise, which would need superb mechanical quality factor that is quite difficult to achieve by using currently-available low-loss mechanical oscillators; one possible solution is to use optical dilution of the mechanical damping, which can considerably relax the requirement on the mechanics.},

Unfortunately, quantum states of increasingly macroscopic objects are more easily corrupted by unintentional measurements from the classical environment. Additionally, even the intentional measurements from the observer can further perturb the system. In optomechanics, coherent light fields serve as the intermediary between the fragile mechanical states and our inherently classical world by exerting radiation pressure forces and extracting mechanical information. Here we engineer a microwave cavity optomechanical system to stabilize a nonclassical steady-state of motion while independently, continuously, and nondestructively monitoring it. By coupling the motion of an aluminum membrane to two microwave cavities, we separately prepare and measure a squeezed state of motion. We demonstrate a quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of sub-vacuum mechanical quadrature fluctuations. The techniques developed here have direct applications in the areas of quantum-enhanced sensing and quantum information processing, and could be further extended to more complex quantum states.},

Physical, optical, and electronic aspects of this discriminator/laser frequency stabilization system are considered in detail. It is shown that a high-speed domain exists in which the system responds to the phase (rather than frequency) change of the laser; thus with suitable design the servo loop bandwidth is not limited by the cavity response time. Diagnostic experiments are reported in which a dye laser and gas laser were independently locked to one stable cavity. Because of the precautions employed, the observed sub-100 Hz beat line width shows that the lasers were this stable. Applications of this system of laser stabilization include precision laser spectroscopy and interferometric gravity-wave detectors.},

Pioneering photon counting experiments, such as the intensity interferometry performed by Hanbury Brown and Twiss to measure the angular width of visible stars, have played a critical role in our understanding of the full quantum nature of light. As with matter at the atomic scale, the laws of quantum mechanics also govern the properties of macroscopic mechanical objects, providing fundamental quantum limits to the sensitivity of mechanical sensors and transducers. Current research in cavity optomechanics seeks to use light to explore the quantum properties of mechanical systems ranging in size from kilogram-mass mirrors to nanoscale membranes, as well as to develop technologies for precision sensing and quantum information processing. Here we use an optical probe and single-photon detection to study the acoustic emission and absorption processes in a silicon nanomechanical resonator, and perform a measurement similar to that used by Hanbury Brown and Twiss to measure correlations in the emitted phonons as the resonator undergoes a parametric instability formally equivalent to that of a laser. Owing to the cavity-enhanced coupling of light with mechanical motion, this effective phonon counting technique has a noise equivalent phonon sensitivity of 0.89 ± 0.05. With straightforward improvements to this method, a variety of quantum state engineering tasks using mesoscopic mechanical resonators would be enabled, including the generation and heralding of single-phonon Fock states and the quantum entanglement of remote mechanical elements.},

These demonstrated parameters provide access to a single-photon cooperativity $C_0=7$ in the resolved-sideband limit, and should enable quantum nondemolition readout of phonon shot noise with a signal-to-noise ratio of $250$ in a single-port cavity. Alternatively (or simultaneously), these structures could be optically trapped to boost the mechanical quality factor to a value exceeding $10^8$, at which point it should be possible to laser cool its motion from room temperature to the quantum ground state.},

   abstract = {The quality factor (Q) for different resonators driven at several\novertones has been determined between 1.5 and 300 K. These measurements\ngive an improved interpretation of the Q-factor limitation. A\nsignificant consequence is a better understanding of the relationship\nbetween Q and random frequency fluctuations. The curves of 1/Q=F(T) show\nthe usual features between 20 and 300 K. These include the sodium ion\npeak at 55 K as well as a peak at 20 K. However, the region of principal\ninterest lies between 1.5 and 20 K. At very low temperatures, a plateau\nis always observed. If for a given resonator, the 1/Q value of this\nplateau is subtracted from the experimental values, the residual 1/Q is\nalmost a linear function of T 4 . This variation obeys the\nLandau-Rumer theory of acoustic wave absorption caused by phonon-phonon\ninteraction in the crystal. Thus the authors conclude that between 6 and\n20 K the main limitation in Q is due to the crystal itself, but the\nplateau is not caused by intrinsic crystal properties. Data for\ndifferent overtones enable the elimination, at least for the seventh\novertone, of damping effects of the crystal supports. Measurements have\nalso been carried out on crystals with crystal surfaces with different\nroughness characteristics. These roughness characteristics have been\nmeasured using optical interferometry. With a well polished, good\ncrystal the authors measured, for the seventh overtone at 3 K a loaded Q\nof 25 million corresponding to an unloaded Q of 33 million. Better\ncontrol of surface roughness and crystal quality could lead to a Q of\nabout 100 million in the liquid helium region. This value would be for\nan 11 MHz, seventh overtone crystal having an diameter of 15 mm},

When probing the thermal noise of the coupled nanomechanical device, we observe a significant deviation from the normal mode expansion. It originates from the heterogeneous character of mechanical dissipation over the spatial extension of coupled eigenmodes, which violates one of the fundamental prerequisite for employing this commonly used description of the nanoresonators' thermal noise. We subsequently measure the local mechanical susceptibility and demonstrate that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem still holds and permits a proper evaluation of the thermal noise of the nanomechanical system. Since it naturally becomes delicate to ensure a good spatial homogeneity at the nanoscale, this approach is fundamental to correctly describe the thermal noise of nanomechanical systems which ultimately impact their sensing capacity.},

   abstract = {Quantum enhanced sensing is a powerful technique in which nonclassical states are used to improve the sensitivity of a measurement. For enhanced mechanical displacement sensing, squeezed states of light have been shown to reduce the photon counting noise that limits the measurement noise floor. It has long been predicted, however, that suppressing the noise floor with squeezed light should produce an unavoidable increase in radiation pressure noise that drives the mechanical system. Such nonclassical radiation pressure forces have thus far been hidden by insufficient measurement strengths and residual thermal mechanical motion. Since the ultimate measurement sensitivity relies on the delicate balance between these two noise sources, the limits of the quantum enhancement have not been observed. Using a microwave cavity optomechanical system, we observe the nonclassical radiation pressure noise that necessarily accompanies any quantum enhancement of the measurement precision. By varying both the magnitude and phase of the squeezing, we optimize the fundamental trade-off between mechanical imprecision and backaction noise in accordance with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As the strength of the measurement is further increased, radiation pressure forces eventually dominate the mechanical motion. In this regime, the optomechanical interaction can be exploited as an efficient quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of the amplitude fluctuations of the light field. By overwhelming mechanical thermal noise with radiation pressure by two orders of magnitude, we demonstrate a mechanically-mediated measurement of the squeezing with an effective homodyne efficiency of 94%. Thus, with strong radiation pressures forces, mechanical motion enhances the measurement of nonclassical light, just as nonclassical light enhances the measurement of the motion.},

   abstract = {Dielectric membranes with exceptional mechanical and optical properties present one of the most promising platforms in quantum opto-mechanics. The performance of stressed silicon nitride nanomembranes as mechanical resonators notoriously depends on how their frame is clamped to the sample mount, which in practice usually necessitates delicate, and difficult-to-reproduce mounting solutions. Here, we demonstrate that a phononic bandgap shield integrated in the membrane's silicon frame eliminates this dependence, by suppressing dissipation through phonon tunneling. We dry-etch the membrane's frame so that it assumes the form of a cm-sized bridge featuring a 1-dimensional periodic pattern, whose phononic density of states is tailored to exhibit one, or several, full band gaps around the membrane's high-Q modes in the MHz-range. We quantify the effectiveness of this phononic bandgap shield by optical interferometry measuring both the suppressed transmission of vibrations, as well as the influence of frame clamping conditions on the membrane modes. We find suppressions up to 40 dB and, for three different realized phononic structures, consistently observe significant suppression of the dependence of the membrane's modes on sample clamping-if the mode's frequency lies in the bandgap. As a result, we achieve membrane mode quality factors of 5 × 106 with samples that are tightly bolted to the 8 K-cold finger of a cryostat. Q × f -products of 6 × 1012 Hz at 300 K and 14 × 1012 Hz at 8 K are observed, satisfying one of the main requirements for optical cooling of mechanical vibrations to their quantum ground-state.},

   abstract = {Resonant micro and nanostrings were found to have extraordinarily high quality factors (Qs). Since the discovery of the highQs of silicon nitride nanostrings, the understanding of the underlying mechanisms allowing such high quality factors has been a topic of several investigations. So far it has been concluded thatQis enhanced due to the high energy stored in the string tension. In this paper, damping mechanisms in string resonators are systematically investigated by varying the geometry and the tensile stress of silicon nitride microstrings. The measured quality factors are compared to an analytical model for Q based on bending-related damping mechanisms. It is shown that internal material damping is limiting the quality factor of narrow strings with a width of 3 µm. Q is strongly width dependent and clamping losses evidently seem to be the limiting damping mechanism for wider strings. It is further shown that Q is influenced by interference effects in the substrate and thus by the clamping of the macroscopic chip. A maximum quality factor of up to 7 million is presented for high-stress silicon nitride strings with a resonance frequency of 176 kHz.},

We show that even at cold temperatures thermally occupied mechanical modes of the cavity elements can be a limitation, and we discuss methods to reduce these effects sufficiently for achieving ground state cooling.

   abstract = {Macroscopic mechanical objects and electromagnetic degrees of freedom can couple to each other through radiation pressure. Optomechanical systems in which this coupling is sufficiently strong are predicted to show quantum effects and are a topic of considerable interest. Devices in this regime would offer new types of control over the quantum state of both light and matter, and would provide a new arena in which to explore the boundary between quantum and classical physics. Experiments so far have achieved sufficient optomechanical coupling to laser-cool mechanical devices, but have not yet reached the quantum regime. The outstanding technical challenge in this field is integrating sensitive micromechanical elements (which must be small, light and flexible) into high-finesse cavities (which are typically rigid and massive) without compromising the mechanical or optical properties of either. A second, and more fundamental, challenge is to read out the mechanical element's energy eigenstate. Displacement measurements (no matter how sensitive) cannot determine an oscillator's energy eigenstate, and measurements coupling to quantities other than displacement have been difficult to realize in practice. Here we present an optomechanical system that has the potential to resolve both of these challenges. We demonstrate a cavity which is detuned by the motion of a 50-nm-thick dielectric membrane placed between two macroscopic, rigid, high-finesse mirrors. This approach segregates optical and mechanical functionality to physically distinct structures and avoids compromising either. It also allows for direct measurement of the square of the membrane's displacement, and thus in principle the membrane's energy eigenstate. We estimate that it should be practical to use this scheme to observe quantum jumps of a mechanical system, an important goal in the field of quantum measurement.},

For our optically based position measurements, the back-action takes the form of a fluctuating radiation pressure from the Poisson-distributed photons in the coherent measurement field, termed radiation pressure shot noise. We demonstrate a back-action force that is comparable in magnitude to the thermal forces in our system. Additionally, we observe a temporal correlation between fluctuations in the radiation force and in the position of the resonator.},

We experimentally demonstrate strong and continuous optomechanical squeezing of 1.7 +/- 0.2 dB below the shot noise level.

   abstract = {Low-loss transmission and sensitive recovery of weak radio-frequency and microwave signals is a ubiquitous challenge, crucial in radio astronomy, medical imaging, navigation, and classical and quantum communication. Efficient up-conversion of radio-frequency signals to an optical carrier would enable their transmission through optical fibres instead of through copper wires, drastically reducing losses, and would give access to the set of established quantum optical techniques that are routinely used in quantum-limited signal detection. Research in cavity optomechanics has shown that nanomechanical oscillators can couple strongly to either microwave or optical fields. Here we demonstrate a room-temperature optoelectromechanical transducer with both these functionalities, following a recent proposal using a high-quality nanomembrane. A voltage bias of less than 10 V is sufficient to induce strong coupling between the voltage fluctuations in a radio-frequency resonance circuit and the membrane's displacement, which is simultaneously coupled to light reflected off its surface. The radio-frequency signals are detected as an optical phase shift with quantum-limited sensitivity. The corresponding half-wave voltage is in the microvolt range, orders of magnitude less than that of standard optical modulators. The noise of the transducer--beyond the measured 800 pV Hz-1/2 Johnson noise of the resonant circuit--consists of the quantum noise of light and thermal fluctuations of the membrane, dominating the noise floor in potential applications in radio astronomy and nuclear magnetic imaging. Each of these contributions is inferred to be 60 pV Hz-1/2 when balanced by choosing an electromechanical cooperativity of ~150 with an optical power of 1 mW. The noise temperature of the membrane is divided by the cooperativity. For the highest observed cooperativity of 6,800, this leads to a projected noise temperature of 40 mK and a sensitivity limit of 5 pV Hz-1/2. Our approach to all-optical, ultralow-noise detection of classical electronic signals sets the stage for coherent up-conversion of low-frequency quantum signals to the optical domain.},

However, no current technology can convert low-frequency microwave signals into high-frequency optical signals while preserving their fragile quantum state.

Stress-relieved cantilevers fabricated from the same material show a Q that is more consistent with typical disordered materials. e-beam and x-ray studies of the nitride film's structure reveal characteristics consistent with a disordered state.

We analyze the dissipation mechanism that arises in nanomechanical beam-structures due to the tunneling of mesoscopic phonons between the beam and its supports (known as clamping losses). We derive the environmental force spectral density that determines the quantum Brownian motion of a given resonance. Our treatment is valid for low frequencies and provides the leading contribution in the aspect ratio. This yields fundamental limits for the Q-values which are described by simple scaling laws and are relevant for state of the art experimental structures. In this context, for resonant frequencies in the 0.1-1GHz range, while this dissipation mechanism can limit flexural resonators it is found to be negligible for torsional ones. In the case of structureless 3D supports the corresponding environmental spectral densities are Ohmic for flexural resonators and super-Ohmic for torsional ones, while for 2D slab supports they yield 1/f noise. Furthermore analogous results are established for the case of suspended semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes. Finally, we provide a general expression for the spectral density that allows to extend our treatment to other geometries and illustrate its use by applying it to a microtoroid. Our analysis is relevant for applications in high precision measurements and for the prospects of probing quantum effects in a macroscopic mechanical degree of freedom.},

Significantly, it is observed that the band gaps of a phononic crystal slab are distinct from those of bulk acoustic waves propagating in the plane of an infinite two-dimensional phononic crystal with the same composition.

   abstract = {In this paper we study and design quasi-2D optomechanical crystals, waveguides, and resonant cavities formed from patterned slabs. Two-dimensional periodicity allows for in-plane pseudo-bandgaps in frequency where resonant optical and mechanical excitations localized to the slab are forbidden. By tailoring the unit cell geometry, we show that it is possible to have a slab crystal with simultaneous optical and mechanical pseudo-bandgaps, and for which optical waveguiding is not compromised. We then use these crystals to design optomechanical cavities in which strongly interacting, co-localized photonic-phononic resonances occur. A resonant cavity structure formed by perturbing a "linear defect" waveguide of optical and acoustic waves in a silicon optomechanical crystal slab is shown to support an optical resonance at wavelength lambda(0) approximate to 1.5 mu m and a mechanical resonance of frequency omega(m)/2 pi approximate to 9.5 GHz. These resonances, due to the simultaneous pseudo-bandgap of the waveguide structure, are simulated to have optical and mechanical radiation-limited Q-factors greater than 10(7). The optomechanical coupling of the optical and acoustic resonances in this cavity due to radiation pressure is also studied, with a quantum conversion rate, corresponding to the scattering rate of a single cavity photon via a single cavity phonon, calculated to be g/2 pi = 292 kHz.

   abstract = {It has been over 100 years since the rst conclusive demonstration of radiation pressure by Lebedev and Nichols and Hull. Cavity optomechanical systems - high-finesse optical cavities coupled to mechanical resonators - are good testing grounds for the mechanical properties of light. The system described in this dissertation is a 7 mm long cavity coupled to a 1 mm square, 50 nm thick silicon nitride membrane. Like many similar optomechanical systems, ranging from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory to microtoroids, this work has moved beyond detecting the steady state force of light on a mirror to a rich array of dynamical effects. Classical effects include shifts in the mechanical resonant frequency and optical damping, both of which are demonstrated in this thesis. The (relatively) strong coupling between the light and mechanical resonator can, in principle, demonstrate effects beyond classical mechanics and classical light. This thesis represents an attempt to directly measure random quantum fluctuations in the force of light reflecting from a surface, an effect we call the radiation pressure shot noise. A correlation measurement scheme developed theoretically by Børkje et al. was implemented. This measurement scheme is capable of distinguishing the effects of the random thermal force from the random radiation pressure shot noise. Successful suppression of thermal effects was demonstrated, though unfortunately not to the level required to measure the radiation pressure shot noise. In spite of not accomplishing this major physics goal, much was learned about this measurement scheme and its potential for future measurements of the radiation pressure shot noise. The dissertation begins with an overview of a variety of physical manifestations of the radiation pressure shot noise. The relevant theoretical formalism is then developed, and the correlation scheme is explained. Our technical accomplishments in developing the correlation measurement scheme are 2 presented. The correlation measurement scheme is then used to accomplish successful suppression of thermal effects consistent with the theory developed by Børkje et al. The paper concludes with a brief look at proposed optomechanical systems that may offer a better opportunity to observe the radiation pressure shot noise.},

Such quantum control is typically achieved using external electric or magnetic fields which drive the system's orbital or spin degrees of freedom. However, most of these approaches require complex and unwieldy antenna or gate structures, and with few exceptions are limited to the regime of weak driving. Here, we present a novel approach to strongly and coherently drive a single electron spin in the solid state using internal strain fields in an integrated quantum device. Specifically, we study individual Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) spins embedded in diamond mechanical oscillators and exploit the intrinsic strain coupling between spin and oscillator to strongly drive the spins. As hallmarks of the strong driving regime, we directly observe the energy spectrum of the emerging phonon-dressed states and employ our strong, continuous driving for enhancement of the NV spin coherence time. Our results constitute a first step towards strain-driven, integrated quantum devices and open new perspectives to investigate unexplored regimes of strongly driven multi-level systems and to study exotic spin dynamics in hybrid spin-oscillator devices.},

In particular, suspended nanomem-branes obtained by chemical release of a high-tensile stress layer are an advantageous platform for such transducers, combining an extremely high mechanical quality factor and a low mass. We demonstrate the successful implementation of a photonic-crystal reflector on a high-tensile stress $Si\_3N\_4$ nanomembrane, enabling its direct coupling to a high-finesse optical cavity. This approach is particularly well suited for hybrid opto-electro-mechanical transducers, where the membrane motion is simultaneously coupled to an optical and a microwave cavity. We provide an illustration of the physical process underlying the high reflectivity by measuring the photonic crystal band diagram. Moreover, we introduce a clear theoretical description of the membrane scattering properties in the presence of optical losses. By embedding the photonic-crystal membrane inside a high-finesse cavity, we fully characterize its optical properties. The spectrally resolved measurements demonstrate the wide tunability of the membrane's reflectivity, from nearly 0 to 99.79 $\pm$ 0.02%, and show that the material absorption is not the main source of optical losses.},

We demonstrate that this regime allows for mechanically-induced amplification (or cooling) of the electromagnetic mode.

In addition, we analyze the parametric instability, i.e. optomechanical Brillouin lasing, and contrast it to conventional optomechanical phonon lasing.

We derive a semi-classical model to describe both effects and evaluate the stationary state of the resonator mode under various driving conditions. In particular, we find that by exploiting resonant single and multi-phonon transitions between near-degenerate electronic states, the coupling to high-frequency vibrational modes can be significantly enhanced and dominate over the intrinsic mechanical dissipation.

Typically, methods based on optical forces are used, but these are generally weak and difficult to apply to many materials. An important example is graphene, which is an excellent mechanical resonator due to its low mass and whose unique properties render it an outstanding platform for nanotechnologies. We describe a protocol wherein quantum vacuum potentials yield a strong dispersive interaction between the displacement of a graphene nanomechanical resonator and a nearby quantum optical emitter. This interaction yields a large position-dependent shift in the transition frequency of the emitter, which can be read out via an optical field. Under realistic conditions, we show that this mechanism enables strong quantum squeezing of the graphene position on time scales short compared to the mechanical period.},

The quantum interface to couple the membrane and the superatom can be a pumped single mode cavity, or a laser field in free space, where the Rydberg superatom and the membrane are spatially separated. In addition to the coherent dynamics, we study in detail the impact of the typical dissipation processes, in particular the radiative decay as a source for incoherent superpositions of atomic excitations. We identify the conditions to suppress these incoherent dynamics and thereby a parameter regime for strong coupling.

   abstract = {Magnetic relaxation processes were first discussed for a crystal of paramagnetic transition ions. It was suggested that mechanical vibrations of the crystal lattice (phonons) modulate the crystal electric field of the magnetic ion, thus inducing a 'direct' relaxation between two different spin states. Direct relaxation has also been predicted for single-molecule magnets with a large spin and a high magnetic anisotropy and was first demonstrated in a Mn12 acetate crystal. The spin-lattice relaxation time for such a direct transition is limited by the phonon density of states at the spin resonance. In a three-dimensional system, such as a single-molecule magnet crystal, the phonon energy spectrum is continuous, but in a one-dimensional system, like a suspended carbon nanotube, the spectrum is discrete and can be engineered to an extremely low density of states. An individual single-molecule magnet, coupled to a suspended carbon nanotube, should therefore exhibit extremely long relaxation times and the system's reduced size should result in a strong spin-phonon coupling. Here, we provide the first experimental evidence for a strong spin-phonon coupling between a single molecule spin and a carbon nanotube resonator, ultimately enabling coherent spin manipulation and quantum entanglement.},

The fabrication of the PBS is compatible with other micro diffractive elements to build a micro optical bench, thus, feasible for short wavelength optical storage applications.},

So far, optomechanics relies on the detuning between the cavity and an external pump laser, where the laser acts only as a power supply. Here, we report a new scheme with mutual coupling between a mechanical oscillator that supports a mirror of a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) and the optical field, greatly enhancing the light-matter energy transfer. In this work, we used an ultra-light-weight (130 pg) high-contrast-grating (HCG) mirror in a VCSEL, whose reflectivity spectrum is designed to facilitate strong optomechanical coupling, to demonstrate optomechanically-induced regenerative oscillation of the laser optomechanical cavity with > 550 nm self-oscillation amplitude of the micro-mechanical oscillator, two to three orders of magnitude larger than typical. This new scheme not only offers an efficient approach for high-speed wavelength-swept sources, but also has far-reaching significance in the realization of quantum entanglement of macroscopic objects and ultrasensitive measurement of displacements and forces.},

   abstract = {In contrast to a conventional symmetric Lorentzian resonance, Fano resonance is predominantly used to describe asymmetric-shaped resonances, which arise from the constructive and destructive interference of discrete resonance states with broadband continuum states. This phenomenon and the underlying mechanisms, being common and ubiquitous in many realms of physical sciences, can be found in a wide variety of nanophotonic structures and quantum systems, such as quantum dots, photonic crystals, plasmonics, and metamaterials. The asymmetric and steep dispersion of the Fano resonance profile promises applications for a wide range of photonic devices, such as optical filters, switches, sensors, broadband reflectors, lasers, detectors, slow-light and non-linear devices, etc. With advances in nanotechnology, impressive progress has been made in the emerging field of nanophotonic structures. One of the most attractive nanophotonic structures for integrated photonics is the two-dimensional photonic crystal slab (2D PCS), which can be integrated into a wide range of photonic devices. The objective of this manuscript is to provide an in depth review of the progress made in the general area of Fano resonance photonics, focusing on the photonic devices based on 2D PCS structures. General discussions are provided on the origins and characteristics of Fano resonances in 2D PCSs. A nanomembrane transfer printing fabrication technique is also reviewed, which is critical for the heterogeneous integrated Fano resonance photonics. The majority of the remaining sections review progress made on various photonic devices and structures, such as high quality factor filters, membrane reflectors, membrane lasers, detectors and sensors, as well as structures and phenomena related to Fano resonance slow light effect, nonlinearity, and optical forces in coupled PCSs. It is expected that further advances in the field will lead to more significant advances towards 3D integrated photonics, flat optics, and flexible optoelectronics, with lasting impact in areas ranging from computing, communications, to sensing and imaging systems. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

We give a general description of the aberrations for an axial beam. The extinction is calculated as a function of the numerical aperture for uncoated lenses and for plane parallel plates. In our theoretical analysis, the polarization of output rays is described as a function of the input ray parameters, the shape factor, and refractive index of the lenses used. For rays that are inclined to the optical axis, optimal lens shape factors that minimize the rays' polarization aberrations are found. Techniques for measurement of radially symmetric birefringence in a lens system are described. Finally, we discuss strategies for polarization rectification and introduce new designs including meniscus rectifiers and a liquid crystal rectifier that can actively compensate a wide variety of polarization aberrations. Good correlations between theory and experimental results for microscope optical systems with coated and uncoated optical elements are found. Our results enable us to suppress depolarization and remove anomalous diffraction in a modern microscope equipped with high-numerical-aperture lenses. &copy;2002 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

We briefly discuss sensor fabrication and show measured binding dynamics for example biomaterials in use in our laboratories. We then turn our attention to a particularly powerful attribute of this technology not possessed by competing methods. This attribute is the facile generation of multiple resonance peaks at an identical physical location on the sensor surface. These peaks respond uniquely to the biomolecular event, thereby enriching the data set available for event quantification. The peaks result from individual, polarization-dependent resonant leaky modes that are the foundation of this technology. Thus, by modeling the binding event and fitting to a rigorous electromagnetic formalism, we can determine individual attributes of the biolayer and its surroundings and avoid a separate reference site for background monitoring. Examples provide dual-polarization quantification of biotin binding to a silane-coated sensor as well as binding of the cancer biomarker protein calreticulin to its monoclonal IgG capture antibody. Finally, we present dual-polarization resonance response for poly (allylamine hydrochloride) binding to the sensor with corresponding results of backfitting to a simple model; this differentiates the contributions from biolayer adhesion and background changes.},

   abstract = {Controlling the interaction between localized optical and mechanical excitations has recently become possible following advances in micro-and nanofabrication techniques(1,2). So far, most experimental studies of optomechanics have focused on measurement and control of the mechanical subsystem through its interaction with optics, and have led to the experimental demonstration of dynamical back-action cooling and optical rigidity of the mechanical system(1,3). Conversely, the optical response of these systems is also modified in the presence of mechanical interactions, leading to effects such as electromagnetically induced transparency(4) (EIT) and parametric normal-mode splitting(5). In atomic systems, studies(6,7) of slow and stopped light (applicable to modern optical networks(8) and future quantum networks(9)) have thrust EIT to the forefront of experimental study during the past two decades. Here we demonstrate EIT and tunable optical delays in a nanoscale optomechanical crystal, using the optomechanical nonlinearity to control the velocity of light by way of engineered photon-phonon interactions. Our device is fabricated by simply etching holes into a thin film of silicon. At low temperature (8.7 kelvin), we report an optically tunable delay of 50 nanoseconds with near-unity optical transparency, and superluminal light with a 1.4 microsecond signal advance. These results, while indicating significant progress towards an integrated quantum optomechanical memory(10), are also relevant to classical signal processing applications. Measurements at room temperature in the analogous regime of electromagnetically induced absorption show the utility of these chip-scale optomechanical systems for optical buffering, amplification, and filtering of microwave-over-optical signals.},

Here experimental results for an optomechanical interaction in a polarization nondegenerate system are presented and schemes are proposed for how to use this interaction to perform accurate side-band thermometry and to create novel forms of photon-phonon entanglement. The experimental system utilizes the compressive force in the mirror attached to a mechanical resonator to create a micro-mirror with two radii of curvature which leads, when combined with a second mirror, to a significant polarization splitting of the cavity modes.},

This paper considers the automation of the ``test fringes\{''\} method which is based on the use of a Babinet compensator or of a beam subjected to bending. In particular, two automated methods are proposed: the first one is based on the use of the centre fringe method in monochromatic light and the second one is based on the use of RGB photoelasticity in white light. The proposed methods have been applied to the analysis of membranal residual stresses in some tempered glasses, showing that they can effectively replace manual methods of photoelastic analysis of residual stresses in glass.},

   abstract = {Perturbation theory permits the analytic study of small changes on known solutions, and is especially useful in electromagnetism for understanding weak interactions and imperfections. Standard perturbation-theory techniques, however, have difficulties when applied to Maxwell's equations for small shifts in dielectric interfaces (especially in high-index-contrast, three-dimensional systems) due to the discontinuous field boundary conditions--in fact, the usual methods fail even to predict the lowest-order behavior. By considering a sharp boundary as a limit of anisotropically smoothed systems, we are able to derive a correct first-order perturbation theory and mode-coupling constants, involving only surface integrals of the unperturbed fields over the perturbed interface. In addition, we discuss further considerations that arise for higher-order perturbative methods in electromagnetism.},

   abstract = {Interfacing a single photon with another quantum system is a key capability in modern quantum information science. It allows quantum states of matter, such as spin states of atoms, atomic ensembles or solids, to be prepared and manipulated by photon counting and, in particular, to be distributed over long distances. Such light-matter interfaces have become crucial for fundamental tests of quantum physics as well as for realizations of quantum networks. Here we report nonclassical correlations between single photons and phonons -- the quanta of mechanical motion -- from a nanomechanical resonator. We implement a full quantum protocol involving initialization of the resonator in its quantum ground state of motion and subsequent generation and readout of correlated photon-phonon pairs. The observed violation of a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is clear evidence for the nonclassical nature of the generated mechanical state. Our results show the availability of on-chip solid-state mechanical resonators as light-matter quantum interfaces. The demonstrated performance enables studies of macroscopic quantum phenomena as well as applications in quantum communication, as quantum memories, and as quantum transducers.},

According to quantum mechanics, any detector or amplifier is required to add a certain amount of noise to the signal, equaling at best the energy of quantum fluctu-ations[1, 2]. The quantum limit of added noise has nearly been reached with supercon-ducting devices which take advantage of nonlinearities in Josephson junctions[3, 4]. Here, we introduce a new paradigm of amplification of microwave signals with the help of a mechanical oscillator. By relying on the radiation pressure force on a nanomechanical resonator[5–7], we provide an experimental demonstration and an analytical description of how the injection of microwaves induces coherent stimulated emission and signal am-plification. This scheme, based on two linear oscillators, has the advantage of being con-ceptually and practically simpler than the Josephson junction devices, and, at the same time, has a high potential to reach quantum limited operation. With a measured signal amplification of 25 decibels and the addition of 20 quanta of noise, we anticipate near},

A drawback is that the effect of one photon tends to be tiny, and hence one of the pressing challenges is to substantially increase the interaction strength. A novel scenario is to introduce into the setup a quantum two-level system (qubit), which, besides strengthening the coupling, allows for rich physics via strongly enhanced nonlinearities. Here we present a design of cavity optomechanics in the microwave frequency regime involving a Josephson junction qubit. We demonstrate boosting of the radiation–pressure interaction by six orders of magnitude, allowing to approach the strong coupling regime. We observe nonlinear phenomena at single-photon energies, such as an enhanced damping attributed to the qubit. This work opens up nonlinear cavity optomechanics as a plausible tool for the study of quantum properties of motion.},

They reduce dephasing errors by applying control pulses designed to reverse erroneous coherent evolution driven by environmental noise. However, such methods cannot correct for irreversible processes such as energy relaxation. We investigate a complementary, stochastic approach to reducing errors: instead of deterministically reversing the unwanted qubit evolution, we use control pulses to shape the noise environment dynamically. In the context of superconducting qubits, we implement a pumping sequence to reduce the number of unpaired electrons (quasiparticles) in close proximity to the device. A 70% reduction in the quasiparticle density results in a threefold enhancement in qubit relaxation times and a comparable reduction in coherence variability.},

Recent experiments with superconducting resonators indicates that interaction between TLS in the oxide at the film-substrate interface is not negligible. Here we present data on the loss and frequency noise from two different Nb resonators with and without Pt capping and discuss what conclusions can be drawn regarding the properties of TLS in amorphous oxides. We also estimate the concentration and dipole moment of the TLS.},

Here, we present a study of surface loss in transmon devices, explicitly designed to have varying sensitivities to different surface loss contributors. Our experiments also encompass two particular different sapphire substrates, which reveal the onset of a yet unknown additional loss mechanism outside of surface loss for one of the substrates. Tests across different wafers and devices demonstrate substantial variation, and we emphasize the importance of testing large numbers of devices for disentangling different sources of decoherence.},

   abstract = {Dynamical systems, whether classical or quantum, usually require a method to stabilize performance and maintain the required state. For instance, communication between computers requires error correction codes to ensure that information is transferred correctly. In a quantum system, however, the very act of measuring it can perturb it. Leghtas et al. show that engineering the interaction between a quantum system and its environment can induce stability for the delicate quantum states, a process that could simplify quantum information processing.Science, this issue p. 853 Physical systems usually exhibit quantum behavior, such as superpositions and entanglement, only when they are sufficiently decoupled from a lossy environment. Paradoxically, a specially engineered interaction with the environment can become a resource for the generation and protection of quantum states. This notion can be generalized to the confinement of a system into a manifold of quantum states, consisting of all coherent superpositions of multiple stable steady states. We have confined the state of a superconducting resonator to the quantum manifold spanned by two coherent states of opposite phases and have observed a Schr\{ö\}dinger cat state spontaneously squeeze out of vacuum before decaying into a classical mixture. This experiment points toward robustly encoding quantum information in multidimensional steady-state manifolds.},

   abstract = {A minimal observable length is a common feature of theories that aim to merge quantum physics and gravity. Quantum mechanically, this concept is associated with a nonzero minimal uncertainty in position measurements, which is encoded in deformed commutation relations. In spite of increasing theoretical interest, the subject suffers from the complete lack of dedicated experiments and bounds to the deformation parameters have just been extrapolated from indirect measurements. As recently proposed, low-energy mechanical oscillators could allow to reveal the effect of a modified commutator. Here we analyze the free evolution of high-quality factor micro- and nano-oscillators, spanning a wide range of masses around the Planck mass mP (≈22 μg). The direct check against a model of deformed dynamics substantially lowers the previous limits on the parameters quantifying the commutator deformation. A minimal observable length leading to deformed commutation relations is a common feature of theories that aim to merge quantum physics and gravity. Here, the authors analyse the free evolution of micro- and nano-oscillators to lower the limits on the parameters quantifying commutator deformation.},

   abstract = {The interaction of the radiation pressure with micro-mechanical oscillators is earning a growing interest for its wide-range applications and for fundamental research. In this contribution we describe the fabrication of a family of opto-mechanical devices specifically designed to ease the detection of ponderomotive squeezing and of entanglement between macroscopic objects and light. These phenomena are not easily observed, due to the overwhelming effects of classical noise sources of thermal origin with respect to the weak quantum fluctuations of the radiation pressure. A low thermal noise background is required, together with a weak interaction between the micro-mirror and this background (i.e. high mechanical quality factors). In the development of our opto-mechanical devices, we heve explored an approach focused on relatively thick silicon oscillators with high reflectivity coating. The relatively high mass is compensated by the capability to manage high power at low temperatures, owing to a favourable geometric factor (thicker connectors) and the excellent thermal conductivity of silicon crystals at cryogenic temperature. We have measured at cryogenic temperatures mechanical quality factors up to 105 in a micro-oscillator designed to reduce as much as possible the strain in the coating layer and the consequent energy dissipation. This design improves an approach applied in micro-mirror and micro-cantilevers, where the coated surface is reduced as much as possible to improve the quality factor. The deposition of the highly reflective coating layer has been carefully integrated in the micro-machining process to preserve its low optical losses.},

This oscillator works in the 200 kHz - 5 MHz range and features a mechanical quality factor of $Q\simeq10^7$ and a Q-frequency product in excess of $6.2 \times 10^\{12\}$ Hz at room temperature, fulfilling the minimum requirement for quantum ground-state cooling of the oscillator in an optomechanical cavity. The device is obtained by MEMS DRIE bulk micromachining with a two-side silicon processing on a Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) wafer. The microfabrication process is quite flexible and additional layers could be deposited over the SiN membrane before the DRIE steps, if required for a sensing application. Therefore, such oscillator is a promising candidate for quantum sensing applications in the context of the emerging field of Quantum Technologies.},

   abstract = {One of the main challenges in physics today is to merge quantum theory and the theory of general relativity into a unified framework. Researches are developing various approaches towards such a theory of quantum gravity, but a major hindrance is the lack of experimental evidence of quantum gravitational effects. Yet, the quantization of space-time itself can have experimental implications: the existence of a minimal length scale is widely expected to result in a modification of the Heisen-berg uncertainty relation. Here we introduce a scheme to experimentally test this conjecture by probing directly the canonical commutation relation of the center-of-mass mode of a mechanical oscillator with a mass close to the Planck mass. Our protocol utilizes quantum optical control and readout of the mechanical system to probe possible deviations from the quantum commutation relation even at the Planck scale. We show that the scheme is within reach of current technology. It thus opens a feasible route for table-top experiments to explore possible quantum gravitational phenomena. It is currently an open question whether our underlying concepts of space-time are fully compatible with those of quantum mechanics. The ongoing search for a quantum theory of gravity is therefore one of the main challenges in modern physics. A major difficulty in the development of such theories is the lack of experimentally accessible phenomena that could shed light on the possible route for quantum gravity. Such phenomena are expected to become relevant near the Planck scale, i.e. at energies on the order of the Planck energy E P = 1.2 × 10 19 GeV or at length scales near the Planck length L P = 1.6 × 10 −35 m, where space-time itself is assumed to be quantized. However, such a minimal length scale is not a feature of quantum theory.},

   abstract = {A frequency-tunable source of squeezed light is employed for spectroscopic measurements of atomic cesium. Relative to the usual quantum limit associated with vacuum-state fluctuations, enhanced sensitivity is demonstrated for the detection of Doppler-free resonances in saturation spectroscopy, with an improvement of 3.1 dB directly observed and 3.8 dB inferred after correcting for detector thermal noise. PACS numbers: 42.62.Fi, 32.80.-t, 42.50.Dv Over the past several years the successful generation of a variety of manifestly quantum or nonclassical states of light has led to the achievement of measurement sensitivity beyond the quantum limit set by the vacuum Auctua-tions of the electromagnetic field [1-6]. Of particular importance both for these demonstrations and within the context of the theory of quantum measurement have been squeezed states of light, which are characterized by a phase-dependent distribution of quantum Auctuations with the variance of one quadrature component of the field dropping below that of the vacuum state [7]. Squeezed light has been employed for improvements in measurement precision beyond the vacuum-state (or shot-noise) limit in Mach-Zehnder [1] and polarization [2] interferometers and for the detection of directly encoded amplitude modulation [3]. In addition to these initial proof-of-principle demonstrations , another area of potentially broad import is that of spectroscopy with squeezed light, where it should likewise be possible to extend sensitivity beyond the usual quantum limit [8]. However, quite apart from issues of enhanced measurement capability, the interaction of squeezed light with atoms can lead to alterations of fundamental atomic radiative processes. Indeed, since the seminal work of Gardiner [9], diverse phenomena involving the atom-field interaction in the presence of the non-classical fluctuations of a squeezed state have been analyzed theoretically, including resonance Auorescence [10], laser operation [11],and cavity quantum electrodynamics [12]. To explore the exciting possibilities suggested by these and other analyses, we have developed a source of frequency-tunable squeezed light suitable for spectroscop-ic applications over a broad range. In this Letter, we present results for operation around 855 nm and report observations of photocurrent noise reduction 5.0 dB below the vacuum-state level. With regard to the quantum limits to sensitivity in atomic spectroscopy, we utilize this source to achieve an improvement in sensitivity of 3.1 dB beyond the vacuum-state limit [13-15]for the detection of Doppler-free resonances in atomic cesium.

Even after painstaking alignment of the interferometer components, and after considerable improvement of the laser stability, noise contributions much in excess of this goal were observed, due partly to fluctuations of the laser beam geometry. The two most obvious types of geometric beam fluctuations are a lateral beam jitter and a pulsation in beam width; these lead to spurious interferometer signals if the interfering wavefronts are misaligned in their tilts or in their curvatures respectively. The geometry of the laser beam can be considerably stabilized by passing it through an optical resonator. The geometric beam fluctuations, as viewed from this resonator, can be described by a well-centred ground mode TEMoo, contaminated by transverse modes TEM mn , with amplitudes decreasing rapidly with the mode order m + n. In the simplest case, the resonator consists of two identical concave mirrors of high reflectance ρ2. The mirror separation can be chosen such that, while the resonator is tuned for maximum transmittance for the TEMoo mode, the low order transverse modes TEM mn are almost totally suppressed, in amplitude by factors of the order of 1 − ρ2. Considerations leading to a practical implementation are discussed, and experimental results are given.},

   abstract = {Thermal frequency fluctuations in optical cavities limit the sensitivity of precision experiments ranging from gravitational wave observatories to optical atomic clocks. Conventional modeling of these noises assumes a linear response of the optical field to the fluctuations of cavity frequency. Fundamentally, however, this response is nonlinear. Here we show that nonlinearly transduced thermal fluctuations of cavity frequency can dominate the broadband noise in photodetection, even when the magnitude of fluctuations is much smaller than the cavity linewidth. We term this noise "thermal intermodulation noise" and show that for a resonant laser probe it manifests as intensity fluctuations. We report and characterize thermal intermodulation noise in an optomechanical cavity, where the frequency fluctuations are caused by mechanical Brownian motion, and find excellent agreement with our developed theoretical model. We demonstrate that the effect is particularly relevant to quantum optomechanics: using a phononic crystal Si 3 N 4 membrane with a low mass, soft-clamped mechanical mode we are able to operate in the regime where measurement quantum backaction contributes as much force noise as the thermal environment does. However, in the presence of intermodulation noise, quantum signatures of measurement are not revealed in direct photodetection. The reported noise mechanism, while studied for an optomechanical system, can exist in any optical cavity.},

We identify optimal regimes of operation, and discuss advantages within the examples of optical levitation and nondestructive phonon measurement. Introduction.-The field of optomechanics [1] explores the forces exerted by light, and increasingly accesses the quantum regime with an eye toward sensing, information, and fundamental tests of macroscopic quantum motion. To date, the vast majority of experimental breakthroughs-room-temperature generation of broadband squeezed light [2], measurement near the Heisenberg limit or below the standard quantum limit [3, 4], quantum information transduction [5], and creation of exotic quantum motion [6], to list just a few-have been achieved in systems having so-called linear dispersive coupling (LDC), wherein an optical resonance frequency depends linearly on the displacement of a mechanical element. As the field advances, systems exhibiting purely quadratic dispersive coupling (QDC), wherein the optical frequency depends on the square of mechanical displacement, promise a wide and increasingly feasible range of applications that are qualitatively different, such as quantum nondemolition (QND) readout of phonon number [7-9] or shot noise [10], generation of exotic quantum states [11-13] or en-tanglement [14], non-reciprocal photon control [15], pho-ton [16] or phonon [17] blockade, and stable center-of-mass [18, 19] or torsional [20] optical traps for geometry tuned [21] and ultrahigh-Q mechanical systems. QDC optomechanical systems can mostly all be mapped onto the 'membrane-in-the-middle' (MIM) [7, 9] paradigm, wherein a partially-reflective membrane splits a Fabry-Perot cavity into two identical sub-cavities, such that their LDC mutually cancels, producing purely QDC to leading order. This configuration has been successfully realized with a membrane in a macroscopic [7] or microscopic [22] cavity, on-chip [23, 24], levitated [25], or with atomic clouds [26]. Importantly, this quadratic dis-persive coupling is always accompanied by a linear dissi-pative coupling [27-34], thereby introducing detrimental quantum radiation force noise (QRFN) [35-37] that can place strict limits on what is possible, especially in the quantum regime [35-37]. As such, understanding and mitigating this noise is of paramount importance. Here we propose an optomechanical geometry that can},

   abstract = {Quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic vacuum produce measurable physical effects such as Casimir forces and the Lamb shift [1]. Similarly, these fluctuations also impose an observable quantum limit to the lowest temperatures that can be reached with conventional laser cooling techniques [2, 3]. As laser cooling experiments continue to bring massive mechanical systems to unprecedented temperatures [4, 5], this quantum limit takes on increasingly greater practical importance in the laboratory [6]. Fortunately, vacuum fluctuations are not immutable, and can be "squeezed" through the generation of entangled photon pairs. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate that squeezed light can be used to sideband cool the motion of a macroscopic mechanical object below the quantum limit. To do so, we first cool a microwave cavity optomechanical system with a coherent state of light to within 15% of this limit. We then cool by more than 2 dB below the quantum limit using a squeezed microwave field generated by a Josephson Parametric Amplifier (JPA). From heterodyne spectroscopy of the mechanical sidebands, we measure a minimum thermal occupancy of 0.19 ± 0.01 phonons. With this novel technique, even low frequency mechanical oscillators can in principle be cooled arbitrarily close to the motional ground state, enabling the exploration of quantum physics in larger, more massive systems. Rapid progress in the control and measurement of massive mechanical oscillators has enabled tests of fundamental physics, as well as applications in sensing and quantum information processing [7]. The noise performance of these experiments , however, is often limited by thermal motion of the mechanical mode. Although the most sophisticated refrigeration technologies can be sufficient for cooling high frequency mechanical structures to the ground state [8, 9], observing quantum behavior in lower frequency mechanical systems requires other cooling methods. Recent efforts using active quantum feedback have been remarkably successful in preparing mo-tional states with low entropies [10]. Thus far, however, only laser cooling techniques similar to those that revolutionized the coherent control of atomic systems [11, 12] have yielded thermal occupancies below one quantum [4-6]. Nevertheless , vacuum fluctuations impose a lowest possible temperature that can be achieved using these techniques [2, 3]. This limit is now being encountered in state of the art experiments involving macroscopic oscillators [6]. The concept of sideband cooling relies on the removal of mechanical energy by scattering incident drive photons to higher frequencies. In general, however, this photon up-conversion (anti-Stokes) process competes with a down-conversion (Stokes) process that adds energy to the mechanical system. In cavity optomechanics [7], a light-matter interaction arises due to a parametric modulation of an optical cavity's resonance frequency with a mechanical oscillator's position. When the cavity is driven at detuning ∆ below its resonance frequency, the difference in the cavity's density of states at the mechanical sideband frequencies leads to a dominant anti-Stokes scattering rate (see Fig. 1). The disparity between the Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering rates grows as the cavity's linewidth, κ, decreases relative to the mechanical os-cillator's resonance frequency, Ω. Accordingly, optomechani-cal systems in the "resolved sideband" limit (κ Ω) can be cooled to low temperatures with coherent states of light. A full quantum analysis, however, shows that vacuum fluctua-Figure 1.

The interaction scatters photons to mechanical side-bands at δ = ±Ω, where Ω denotes the mechanical resonance frequency.

Although the sideband cooling limit rests on an intuitive set of assumptions, it is not a fundamental limit. Proposals to cool below this limit include pulsed cooling schemes [13, 14], dissipative coupling [15], optomechanically-induced transparency [16], and nonlinear interactions [17, 18].

Laser cooling has been a method of choice to prepare mechanical resonators in the quantum ground state, one of the simplest pure states. However, in order to overcome the heating and decoherence by the thermal bath, this usually has to be combined with cryogenic cooling. Here, we laser-cool an ultracoherent, soft-clamped mechanical resonator close to the quantum ground state directly from room temperature. To this end, we implement the versatile membrane-in-the-middle setup with one fiber mirror and one phononic crystal mirror, which reaches a quantum cooperativity close to unity already at room temperature. We furthermore introduce a powerful combination of coherent and measurement-based quantum control techniques, which allows us to overcome thermal intermodulation noise. The lowest occupancy we reach is 20 phonons, limited by detection efficiency.

Teufel et al. have now achieved just that with a recently developed system in which a drum-like flexible aluminium membrane is incorporated in a superconducting circuit. Ground-state cooling of a mechanical resonator was demonstrated for the first time last year in a different type of device, but the quantum states in this new device should be much longer lived, allowing direct tests of fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. As a first step, the authors perform a quantum-limited position measurement that is only a factor of about five away from the Heisenberg limit. The advent of laser cooling techniques revolutionized the study of many atomic-scale systems, fuelling progress towards quantum computing with trapped ions1 and generating new states of matter with Bose–Einstein condensates2. Analogous cooling techniques3,4 can provide a general and flexible method of preparing macroscopic objects in their motional ground state. Cavity optomechanical or electromechanical systems achieve sideband cooling through the strong interaction between light and motion5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15. However, entering the quantum regime—in which a system has less than a single quantum of motion—has been difficult because sideband cooling has not sufficiently overwhelmed the coupling of low-frequency mechanical systems to their hot environments. Here we demonstrate sideband cooling of an approximately 10-MHz micromechanical oscillator to the quantum ground state. This achievement required a large electromechanical interaction, which was obtained by embedding a micromechanical membrane into a superconducting microwave resonant circuit. To verify the cooling of the membrane motion to a phonon occupation of 0.34 ± 0.05 phonons, we perform a near-Heisenberg-limited position measurement3 within (5.1 ± 0.4)h/2π, where h is Planck’s constant. Furthermore, our device exhibits strong coupling, allowing coherent exchange of microwave photons and mechanical phonons16. Simultaneously achieving strong coupling, ground state preparation and efficient measurement sets the stage for rapid advances in the control and detection of non-classical states of motion17,18, possibly even testing quantum theory itself in the unexplored region of larger size and mass19. Because mechanical oscillators can couple to light of any frequency, they could also serve as a unique intermediary for transferring quantum information between microwave and optical domains20.},

@article{Purdy2013,
   abstract = {The quantum mechanics of position measurement of a macroscopic object is typically inaccessible because of strong coupling to the environment and classical noise. Here we monitor a mechanical resonator subject to an increasingly strong continuous position measurement and observe a quantum mechanical backaction force that rises in accordance with the Heisenberg uncertainty limit. For our optically-based position measurements, the backaction takes the form of a fluctuating radiation pressure from the Poisson-distributed photons in the coherent measurement field, termed radiation pressure shot noise. We demonstrate a backaction force that is comparable in magnitude to the thermal forces in our system. Additionally, we observe a temporal correlation between fluctuations in the radiation force and in the position of the resonator. In measuring the trajectory of an object at the scale of our everyday experience we rarely consider the fundamental limitations imposed by quantum mechanics. Yet quantum-mechanical effects are present even when monitoring the position of macroscopic objects and are expected to soon limit, for example, the precision of gravita-tional wave observatories [1]. Imagine measuring the position of an object to an accuracy ∆x. A momentum uncertainty of at least ∆p = /2∆x must then be present, where is the reduced Planck's constant that appears in the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. This requisite momentum (or equivalently velocity) uncertainty adds position uncertainty at a later time. Thus, an observer must weigh pinpointing the location of the object against introducing quantum measurement backaction that obscures the subsequent motion. For an optical position measurement, this quantum backaction is termed radiation pressure shot noise (RPSN) [2, 3]. Here a fluctuating force arises from, for example, the recoil momentum transfer of randomly arriving photons (shot noise) reflecting off an object. In the next generation advanced gravitational wave observatories , such as LIGO [1], Virgo, and KAGRA [4], RPSN is predicted to limit sensitivity even with tens of kilograms test masses. Ideas developed to circumvent quantum limits imposed by backaction include quadrature-squeezed light [5] and backaction evasion techniques [4, 6]. However , for typical objects, the scale of quantum backaction is small compared to thermal motion or classical probing noise. In this report, we observe RPSN on a solid macroscopic (visible to the naked eye) mechanical res-onator by using an optical interferometric measurement of its vibrational motion. Figure 1A shows the canonical picture of a Heisenberg-limited continuous position measurement. The point where the sum of the shot noise measurement impreci-sion (dotted line) and RSPN induced displacement fluctuations (black line) is minimized is termed the standard quantum limit (SQL) [7, 8]. Here, the displacement spectral density from RPSN at the mechanical resonance frequency , ω m , is S SQL z (ω m) = /mω m Γ m , where m and Γ m are the resonator's mass and damping rate. This fundamental scale is equivalent to one half of the resonator's quantum mechanical zero point motion, Z zp. We also define P SQL , the power required for a shot noise limited measurement imprecision of S SQL z (ω m). Even with other mechanical noise sources present (e.g. thermal motion-brown line) quantum backaction may still play an important role if the optical power, P , is sufficiently larger than P SQL. Whereas shot noise is a ubiquitous measurement limitation , experimental signatures of RPSN on solid objects have remained elusive. Mechanical effects of photon recoil are routinely studied in atomic physics [[9] and references therein], and a RPSN observation analogous to ours has been made using a dilute gas of ultracold atoms [10]. A promising route to studying RPSN in solid objects is experiments that achieve high optomechanical coupling to high-frequency, small (nanometer to centimeter scale) mechanical resonators. Using such resonators, groups have initiated searches for RPSN [11, 12], observed classical analogs of RPSN [13], and predicted experimental signatures of RPSN [14-16]. Backaction on a nanomechan-ical resonator has also been observed using other measurement devices such as single electron transistors [17]. Resonators have even been cooled with electromagnetic radiation to near their motional ground state, illustrating the capacity for dominant coherent optical forces [18-20]. In these experiments quantum backaction has been limited thus far to the scale of Z zp , whereas in this report we demonstrate a strong backaction heating effect from RPSN. Note also, in near ground state cooling experiments correlations between shot noise and RPSN driven mechanical motion are an important component of the observed optical spectra [21] and are responsible for, for example, the sideband asymmetry observed in [22].},

   abstract = {Controlling a quantum system based on the observation of its dynamics is inevitably complicated by the backaction of the measurement process. Efficient measurements, however, maximize the amount of information gained per disturbance incurred. Real-time feedback then enables both canceling the measurement's backac-tion and controlling the evolution of the quantum state. While such measurement-based quantum control has been demonstrated in the clean settings of cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics, its application to motional degrees of freedom has remained elusive. Here we show measurement-based quantum control of the motion of a millimetre-sized membrane resonator. An optomechanical transducer resolves the zero-point motion of the soft-clamped resonator in a fraction of its millisecond coherence time, with an overall measurement efficiency close to unity. We use this position record to feedback-cool a resonator mode to its quantum ground state (resid-ual thermal occupation ¯ n = 0.29 ± 0.03), 9 dB below the quantum backaction limit of sideband cooling, and six orders of magnitude below the equilibrium occupation of its thermal environment. This realizes a long-standing goal in the field, and adds position and momentum to the degrees of freedom amenable to measurement-based quantum control, with potential applications in quantum information processing and gravitational wave detectors.},

   abstract = {We present the results of theoretical and experimental studies of dispersively coupled (or "membrane in the middle") optomechanical systems. We calculate the linear optical properties of a high finesse cavity containing a thin dielectric membrane. We focus on the cavity's transmission, reflection, and finesse as a function of the membrane's position along the cavity axis and as a function of its optical loss. We compare these calculations with measurements and find excellent agreement in cavities with empty-cavity finesses in the range 10 4-10 5. The imaginary part of the membrane's index of refraction is found to be ∼ 10 −4. We calculate the laser cooling performance of this system, with a particular focus on the less-intuitive regime in which photons "tunnel" through the membrane on a time scale comparable to the membrane's period of oscillation. Lastly, we present calculations of quantum non-demolition measurements of the membrane's phonon number in the low signal-to-noise regime where the phonon lifetime is comparable to the QND readout time.},
