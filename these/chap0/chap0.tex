\chapter*{Introduction to the thesis}
 
 % At the end of the 19th century, the first optical cavity was realised by Alfred Perot and Charles Fabry using two thinly silvered plane glass plates set accurately parallel. The successive reflections of light inside the cavity interfering with each other create sharp resonance peak and it was rapidly clear that this new type of interferometer could be used to perform very precise interferometric measurement.
