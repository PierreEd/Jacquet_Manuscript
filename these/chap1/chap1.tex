The field of quantum optomechanics investigates the interaction between light confined in an optical cavity and mechanical motion, which can take many forms: radiation-pressure induced displacements, thermally driven vibrations, gravitational waves, quantum zero-point fluctuations, etc. The underlying principle is the same: photons can change the resonator dynamics (via radiation pressure, photothermal effects, etc.), and conversely, the motion of the mechanical element modifies the cavity optical field. Measuring the output optical field thereby provides information about the mechanical motion and/or the environment it is coupled to, while appropriately engineering the input optical field enables control of the resonator dynamics. The crucial question that arises for both mechanical motion readout and control is: what are the fundamental limits imposed by quantum mechanics? \\

In the context of gravitational wave detection, it was realized in the 1970s that the sensitivity of interferometers was ultimately limited by quantum fluctuations of the light field used to probe the mechanical motion \cite{Braginsky1968JETP_ClassicalQuantumRestrictions,Caves1980PRL_RadiationPressureFluctuations}. The quantum nature of light imposes two contributions: shot-noise, arising from the intrinsic phase fluctuations of the optical field, and radiation-pressure noise, arising from the optical field amplitude fluctuations driving the mechanical resonator, and translating into an extra phase noise contribution in the detected optical field. These two contributions trade-off against each other, leading to an ultimate sensitivity known as the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) \cite{BraginskyVorontsovThorne1980Science_QND,BraginskyKhalili1992Book_QuantumMeasurement, clerk_introduction_2010}. For gravitational wave interferometers (GWI), where the goal is to measure the mechanical motion induced by gravitational waves, it was then proposed to inject squeezed states of light into the interferometer dark port to reduce quantum noise and improve sensitivity beyond the SQL \cite{caves1981}. On the experimental side, while the shot-noise has been observed in optical interferometers since the 1980s \cite{Loudon1983QuantumTheoryOfLight}, the radiation-pressure noise has however proven very challenging to observe experimentally, as it competes with thermal noise effects which usually dominate for micro-scale mechanical resonators, even at cryogenic temperatures. \\ 

Experimental \textit{tabletop} optomechanics then truly kicked off in the mid 1990s, when stable laser sources, low-loss optical coatings, quantum-limited detection setups and high-Q mm-scale mechanical resonators became available. The idea at the time was to take advantage of the smaller mass of the resonators (compared to the kg-scale of GWI mirrors) to (actually, not so) easily demonstrate the effect of quantum fluctuations of radiation pressure upon the motion of the moving mirror. Notable milestones include the demonstration of radiation-pressure cooling of mechanical resonators in 1999 \cite{cohadon_cooling_1999}, ground state cooling of a mechanical resonator in 2006 \cite{arcizet2006,Gigan2006}, the observation of strong optomechanical coupling in 2009 \cite{groblacher2009}, and the direct observation of radiation-pressure noise in a micro-optomechanical system in 2013 \cite{regal2013}. \\ 

Present research in quantum optomechanics now focus on broad range of topics, that we can loosely put in four main categories: (i) the study of quantum limits in position measurements; (ii) the development of practical optomechanical sensors; (iii) the investigation of the fundamental quantum physics of the mechanical degree of freedom; and (iv) applications to quantum information. These topics all take advantage of the versatility of optomechanical systems, than can be coupled to a large spectrum of systems, such as laser and microwave light, electric and magnetic fields, two-level systems (spins, color centers...), acceleration and forces, etc. 

\section*{Relevance of this work}

This thesis belongs to the first category, where we focus on the use and manipulation of squeezed light to improve the measurement sensitivity beyond the SQL. We do so by leveraging two main experimental ingredients:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frequency-dependent squeezed light} as a sub-SQL probe (Chap. II and V) 
    \item \textbf{Membrane based optomechanical systems} as tunable optomechanical platforms. (Chap. II and IV)
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Frequency-dependent squeezed light:} Squeezed states of light are non-classical states where the quantum fluctuations of one quadrature (amplitude or phase) are reduced below the vacuum level, at the expense of increased fluctuations in the orthogonal quadrature, by virtue of the Heisenberg inequality. Experimentally demonstrated in 1985 \cite{slusher1985squeezed}, squeezed light has since then found applications in quantum information, quantum metrology and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics. In the context of optomechanical measurements, squeezed light can be used to reduce quantum noise and improve sensitivity beyond the SQL \cite{caves1981}. However, due to the trade-off between shot-noise and radiation-pressure noise, frequency-independent squeezed light can only improve sensitivity in a limited frequency band. To achieve broadband sensitivity improvement, it is necessary to use frequency-dependent squeezed light, where the squeezing angle rotates as a function of frequency \cite{klmtv}, and where the frequency range over which the squeezing angle rotates is to be tuned to a specific mechanical resonator, from kg-scale GWI mirrors to ng-scale micro-resonators. The implementation of frequency-dependent squeezing has been a major milestone in the field, with recent demonstrations in gravitational wave interferometers such as advanced GWIs \cite{ Virgo2023, LIGO2020}. \\


With a few experimental demonstrations of frequency-independent squeezing injection in micro/nano-scale optomechanical systems reported in the literature over the past ten years \cite{hoff2013_quantumEnhancedMicromechanical, schafermeier2016_quantumEnhancedFeedbackCooling, clark2016_observationStrongRadiationPressure,li2018_quantumEnhancedOptomechanicalMagnetometry, xia2023_entanglementEnhancedOptomechanicalSensing}, tabletop frequency-dependent squeezing, however, is yet to be routinely injected in mm-scale optomechanical systems. This thesis contributes to this emerging field by presenting the steps toward the development of a frequency-dependent squeezed light source tailored for MHz-frequency membrane-based optomechanical systems. \\ 

\noindent \textbf{Membrane based optomechanical systems:} Membrane-based optomechanical systems consist of a thin dielectric membrane placed inside an optical cavity, forming a so-called "membrane-in-the-middle" (MIM) or "membrane-at-the-end" (MATE) configuration \cite{Thompson2008Nature,Jayich2008NJP}. Introduced in 2008, the MIM architecture has become a popular platform for optomechanics. The smart workaround of using a thin membrane as the mechanical resonator, rather than a moving end-mirror, enables the use of high-finesse cavities with low mechanical loss resonators embedded within, hence splitting the optical and mechanical design constraints. This has led to numerous experimental demonstrations, including approaching the membrane ground state from room temprature \cite{Saarinen23}, strong light mediated coupling between a membrane and a spin \cite{science.abb0328}, state transfer between light and mechanics \cite{PhysRevLett.132.100802}, and membrane assisted squeezing generation \cite{PhysRevX.3.031012, Kippenberg_2024}. \\ 

The MATE configuration, however, remains less explored compared to the MIM configuration, with only a handful of experimental realizations reported in the literature \cite{Dumont:19}. The MATE/MIM geometries display appealing features, such as a large linear coupling range, quadratic points, and greater tunability than standard moving-mirror cavities, making them promising candidates for future optomechanical experiments. \\

All in all, even fewer (if no) research projects have combined both frequency-dependent squeezed light and membrane-based optomechanical systems. This thesis thus aims at bridging this gap by developing the experimental tools necessary to implement frequency-dependent squeezing in a MATE optomechanical cavity, with the long-term goal of demonstrating broadband sub-SQL measurements in such systems. Additionally, this manuscript details the theory of squeezed light optomechanics in depth, and provides various key equations and numerical tools that can be used to model quantum noise in realistic optomechanical systems.
